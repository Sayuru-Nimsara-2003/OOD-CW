1,Pregnant women urged to take up flu and Covid jabs,pregnant women have been encouraged to take up the offer of flu and covid vaccines this winter.  the rollout of the seasonal jabs began in october  and and manx care has reminded expectant mothers they are eligible to receive them free of charge.  the healthcare provider said the viruses could lead to serious illnesses getting the jabs during pregnancy helped protect newborns until they could receive their own.  the season vaccination programmes are open to those over the age of 75  frontline healthcare workers  those who are immunosuppressed  as well as those who are pregnant.   appointments  where both jabs will be available  can be made with the government's vaccination team.  the flu vaccines can also be administered at the island's 14 gp practices  and by local pharmacies across the island by appointment.  north ramsey: clear pharmacy on parliament street   west peel: clear pharmacies on atholl place and michael street  kirk michael: karson’s pharmacy on main road  south ballasalla: costain pharmacy on main road  and kingsley muti pharmacy on the balthane industrial estate  castletown: clear pharmacy on the parade  port erin: clear pharmacy on station road   east douglas: boots on strand street  hemensley's on windsor road  and clear pharmacies castle street  victoria road  and in anagh coar,Health,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2l958qn9v8o
2,Child patients encouraged to play at hospital,clemmie halligey  a paediatric physiotherapist  said: for these children who are poorly they still need those opportunities to play and just because they are unwell doesn't mean they should miss out.  it's really important that they get the opportunities to have that play time and to develop in the way that other children do outside of the hospital.  one of those benefiting from the play therapy is lennon  who is 13-months-old.  a stroke has damaged the nerves on the right side of his body meaning he has some weakness in his right arm and leg.  he also has a diagnosis of cerebral palsy.  his mum ellie says he does not even realise he is doing his physio exercises when he comes to play on the rudham ward.  we noticed that he was weak on one side  she said. then he had an mri scan to confirm it.  but he's improving every day.  he wears a cast on his left arm to encourage him to use the right one when he plays.  she says now it is difficult to see which side is lennon's weaker one because he is recovering so well.  as well as twice-weekly appointments the team at the qeh have been able to put ellie in touch with other support groups for parents who have children with health issues and they have visited the family at home.   nicola wright stands below a sign which says rudham ward. all over the walls and doors are christmas decorations and garlands with pictures of father christmas and reindeer.  play specialist nicola wright says creating a less-clinical environment for children is really important play specialist nicola wright says getting children ready for operations is an important part of the job.  we'll go through the theatre story book in a way that they can understand so they aren't scared when they go to theatre  she said.  we'll even support them when they are in the anaesthetic room with toys and bubbles and books to hopefully make it a bit more of a positive experience.  on the ward children are encouraged to use the play room or take toys back to their beds.  anything that takes the focus off their illness and on to having fun.  ms wright said: recently we've had some children who were actually crying because they didn't want to go home.  that shows you're doing a good job.,Health,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj7r3vm400o
3,Cucumbers recalled in 26 states over possible salmonella contamination,an arizona produce company is recalling all sizes of its whole  fresh american cucumbers in 26 states and parts of canada because they could be contaminated with salmonella  it said.  sunfed said in an announcement posted online thursday by the food and drug administration that cucumbers it sold from oct. 12 to nov. 26 were recalled because of the potential contamination  which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children  frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.  the recalled cucumbers were packaged in bulk cardboard containers marked with the sunfed label or in generic white boxes or black plastic crates with stickers naming the grower  according to the company.  cucumbers recall food safety recalled cucumbers from sunfed were also sold in parts of canada.fda the produce was distributed in 26 states: alaska  arizona  arkansas  california  colorado  connecticut  florida  idaho  illinois  indiana  kansas  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new jersey  new york  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  utah  virginia  washington and wisconsin.  they were also sold in parts of canada  including the provinces of alberta  british columbia  calgary  ontario and saskatchewan.  sunfed said the affected cucumbers would have reached consumers through food service and retail outlets that may be located in states other than those listed.  recommended  u.s. news family of hawaiian woman reported missing is skeptical of lapd conclusion she's not in danger  u.s. news chinese man in u.s. charged with sending weapons to north korea as soon as we learned of this issue  we immediately acted to protect consumers  sunfed president craig slate said in a statement. we are working closely with authorities and the implicated ranch to determine the possible cause.  sunfed urged consumers to check whether their cucumbers match those that were recalled and to avoid consuming or distributing any suspicious produce. they advised customers to throw out any recalled products.  cucumbers also were recalled earlier this year in south florida  where at least 551 people were likely sickened by salmonella and 155 hospitalized.  many of the recalled cucumbers were linked to bedner growers inc.  and thomas produce co.  both of palm beach county  florida  according to the fda. thomas denied its products were directly connected.  the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that salmonella causes about 1.35 million infections in the united states each year.,Health,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cucumbers-recalled-26-states-possible-salmonella-contamination-rcna182241
4,Infant dies  10 sickened amid listeria outbreak tied to ready-to-eat meat,an infant has died and 10 adults have been sickened amid a four-state listeria outbreak connected to ready-to-eat meat products  officials said.  the outbreak has been tied to ready-to-eat meat produced by yu shang food  inc. of spartanburg  south carolina  the centers for disease control and prevention said in an update friday.  among those sickened  there was one person each in new york state and new jersey  two in illinois  and seven in california  including the child who died. all have identified themselves as having asian heritage  the cdc said.  the infant who died was a twin whose sibling also died but whose death could not be linked to listeria. their pregnant mother was also sickened but recovered  the cdc said.  listeria was found in a sample from the mother and from one of the twin infants  but it could not be found in a sample from the other infant  the update stated.  another infant  apparently not related to the twins  became ill and also recovered  it said.  of the eight people sickened  seven shopped at markets where yu shang food products are sold  and two said they recalled eating yu shang food chicken  the cdc update said.  seasoned chicken quarter leg the recall includes yu shang food's seasoned chicken quarter leg.usda contaminated products were discovered during a routine inspection of the yu shang food plant by u.s. department of agriculture (usda) inspectors on oct. 21  which led to a recall on nov. 9 and an expanded recall on thursday  according to a usda statement.  inspectors ultimately found listeria monocytogenes on meat products produced at the plant  the usda said.  in a statement  a spokesperson for yu shang food said the company suspended operations and conducted a recall after the usda found contaminated products during a monthly routine sample test.  recommended  women's health a few bursts of vigorous movement a day may cut women's heart risks  study says  health news mcdonald's e. coli outbreak is over  cdc says “we have been working very closely with the food safety agency to prevent listeria contamination in the future by implementing good sanitation practices in production  the spokesperson told nbc news. we will get food safety expert’s advice if we need to provide safe products for our customers in the future.  the cdc said its investigators determined a genetic footprint for listeria in the outbreak and determined it was similar for all cases. “this suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food ” the cdc said in its update.  the recall covers nearly two dozen varieties of prepared meat that include “braised pork belly in brown sauce ” “seasoned chicken quarter leg ” and “braised beef shank ” according to the usda.  the recalled products were produced before oct. 28 and marked inside usda inspection hallmarks as “p-46684” or “est. m46684.”  the products are sold by at least four retailers  including 99 ranch market.  anyone with the recalled products was urged to discard them  the usda said. freezers and refrigerators that contained the product should be carefully cleaned  the cdc said.  exposure to listeria can cause life-threatening illness for older adults  those with weakened immunity systems  pregnant women  and newborns  the usda said.  listeria infection is the third-ranked cause of death from foodborne illness in the united states  the cdc said.  listeriosis can cause fever  muscle aches  headache  stiff neck  confusion  loss of balance  convulsions and diarrhea  the cdc said. for pregnant women it can infect newborns  it said  and for the elderly it can cause fatal infections.,Health,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/infant-dies-10-sickened-listeria-outbreak-tied-ready-eat-meat-rcna181459
5,Vaccines don't cause autism. What does?,robert f. kennedy jr.’s false claims linking autism to childhood vaccinations are receiving new scrutiny now that president-elect donald trump has selected him to lead the department of health and human services  a sprawling agency with a budget of $1.7 trillion that oversees research into both autism and vaccines.  the myth that autism is caused by childhood vaccines — proposed in 1998 by a british doctor who was later banned from practicing medicine in the united kingdom — has been thoroughly debunked. hundreds of studies have found vaccines to be safe. the world health organization estimates that over the past 50 years  immunizations have saved 154 million lives around the world.  kennedy  who espouses a number of health-related conspiracy theories  has pointed to vaccines to explain the substantial rise in autism diagnoses in recent decades  which have ballooned from an estimated 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today. research suggests that much of that increase is due to increasing awareness and screening for the condition; changing definitions of autism to include milder conditions on the spectrum that weren’t recognized in previous years; as well as advances in diagnostic technology.  “for a very long time  the anti-vaccine movement has been exploiting families of autistic people  promoting a market for pseudo-scientific treatments that don’t provide the answers they’re looking for and that can expose autistic people to real harm ” said ari ne’eman  co-founder of the nonprofit autistic self advocacy network and an assistant professor of health policy and management at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health. “more discredited conspiracy theories linking autism and vaccines are not the answer.”   what is rfk jr.'s agenda for the department of health and human services? 02:55 timothy caulfield  research director at the university of alberta’s health law institute in canada  who studies health misinformation  said that people often are more willing to believe conspiracy theories about conditions such as autism  whose causes are complex and not fully understood  than diseases with clear causes. people seem less inclined to speculate  for example  about alternative explanations for down syndrome  which causes intellectual disabilities and has long been known to be caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.  “it’s really a shame because there are vulnerable families [of people with autism] who need our support ” said judith miller  a clinical psychologist and senior scientist and training director at the center for autism research at children’s hospital of philadelphia. “every dollar and hour spent trying to debunk a conspiracy theory is a dollar and an hour lost that could have been spent trying to understand how to help families.”  a complex condition finding the causes of autism is complicated  because it’s not a single disorder  said manish arora  a professor of environmental medical and climate science at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york.  “autism is a spectrum  not a single narrow disease ” arora said. “it’s many  many things under one umbrella.”  although people diagnosed with autism often have similar strengths and challenges  “there are many paths to autism and many presentations of autism ” miller said.  scientists have found a variety of risk factors for autism — most of which exist before birth — but there is no single cause for a neurological and developmental condition that affects how people interact with others  communicate  learn and behave.  a number of the traits sometimes seen in people with autism — such as being sensitive to loud noises  for example  or finding it difficult to interpret social cues — are also found in people who have not been diagnosed with autism. doctors diagnose autism based on a person’s behavior  noting that there is no simple test for the condition  as there is for covid or diabetes  said arora  founder and ceo of a start-up company that researches biomarkers for autism and other neurological conditions.   finding the cause of an infectious disease — such as influenza  which is caused by the flu virus — is much more straightforward.  while researchers continue to study the factors that influence the development of autistic traits  “the one thing we know doesn’t cause autism is vaccines ” said catherine lord  a psychologist and researcher at the center for autism research and treatment at the ucla david geffen school of medicine.  genetic vulnerability doctors have long known that genes play a large role in autism  simply by noting that autism can run in families. for example  in identical twins — who share all of their dna — if one twin has autism  the other usually does  as well. in the case of fraternal twins — who share about half their dna — if one fraternal twin has autism  the chance that the other will have autism ranges from 53% to 67%  according to an analysis of research studies.  scientists have identified more than 100 genes related to autism  miller said  and genes are believed to play a role in 60% to 80% of cases.  “the genetics of autism have never been better understood ” said dr. gregory cejas  medical director of the autism clinical center and fragile x clinic at the washington university school of medicine. “we’re making leaps and bounds about known genetic causes of autism.”  recommended  women's health a few bursts of vigorous movement a day may cut women's heart risks  study says  health news mcdonald's e. coli outbreak is over  cdc says yet genes clearly don’t explain every case of autism.  autism is very different from conditions like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis  which are caused by a single gene. scientists believe that people develop autistic traits due to a combination of genetic vulnerability and environmental exposures  lord said.  “people have found many  many different genetic patterns associated with autism  but none of them are only associated with autism and none of them are always associated with autism ” lord said.  for example  fragile x syndrome — caused by a mutated gene on the x chromosome — is the most common known cause of autism. but only a fraction of children with the genetic mutation actually develop autism  miller said. it’s possible that this mutation leaves some people more vulnerable to developing autistic characteristics  while others with the same mutations don’t develop autistic traits  because they are shielded by protective factors that have not yet been identified.  some people blamed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with autism because symptoms of the condition often occur at around 12 to 15 months of age  the same time toddlers get that immunization. but miller notes that “most of the genetic conditions that affect our life and health aren’t apparent at birth. symptoms or characteristics won’t show up until later  but the genetic code will have been with us the whole time.”  prenatal vulnerability many of the known risk factors for autistic characteristics occur before birth or at the time of delivery  arora said. babies who experience complications at birth  such as their umbilical cord becoming wrapped around their neck  have a higher risk of autism.   so do babies born prematurely  perhaps because of something that happened in the womb.  children are also slightly more likely to be diagnosed with autism if they have older fathers and possibly if they have older mothers  miller said. it’s not clear if something in the biology of older parents causes a child to have a higher risk of autism  or if socioeconomic issues could play a role. it’s possible that older parents have better access to health care  making it more likely for their child to receive an autism diagnosis.  a mother’s health influences her child’s autism risk in several ways  according to multiple studies: children have a greater chance of being diagnosed with autism if their mothers were exposed to high levels of air pollution or developed a serious infection  such as the flu or pneumonia  while pregnant.  while ne’eman  of the autistic self advocacy network  said he’s not opposed to basic biological research on autism or its causes  he said those studies do little to help people with autism overcome the barriers they face in their everyday lives.   he notes that only 8.4% of the $419 million spent on autism research in the united states is devoted to support and services for people with autism.  “we need an autism research agenda ” he said  “that reflects the true priorities of autistic people and our families: supports across the lifespan and inclusion in the community.”,Health,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837

7,Vaccination rates for flu and Covid are low this season  CDC says,vaccination rates for the flu  covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) are low for adults in the u.s. so far this season  according to a new report from the centers for disease control and prevention.   as of nov. 9  an estimated 35% of u.s. adults had gotten the new flu vaccine  and nearly 18% had received the new covid vaccines  cdc data shows. however  the agency noted that many unvaccinated adults reported that they intend to get their shots.   “there is still time to get vaccinated ” the report said.  the vaccination rate for the flu as of october was roughly equivalent to the same time last year  the cdc found. by the end of 2023  nearly 44% of americans were estimated to have gotten a flu shot.  the rate of covid vaccination is also similar to last november  around 15%.  the cdc has recommended flu and covid shots for everyone 6 months and older.  the findings come amid rising vaccine hesitancy in the u.s.  and a week after president-elect donald trump named robert f. kennedy jr.  a prominent anti-vaccine activist  as his pick for health and human services secretary.  pediatricians have expressed grave concerns about kennedy's expected nomination  predicting that the decision-making power he would have over vaccines could accelerate the number of parents who reject the shots for their kids and consequently lead to deadly outbreaks.  the new cdc report warns that flu  covid and rsv can cause serious illness  particularly for people ages 65 and up and those with certain medical conditions. young children can also be at risk from influenza — there were more than 200 pediatric deaths during the 2023-2024 season  according to the cdc. about 80% of those children weren't vaccinated for the flu.  recommended  women's health a few bursts of vigorous movement a day may cut women's heart risks  study says  health news mcdonald's e. coli outbreak is over  cdc says a second cdc report released thursday found low vaccination coverage among residents of nursing homes. as of nov. 10  only about 3 in 10 nursing home residents had received the new covid vaccine  the researchers found. and among residents who reported their vaccination status  58% had gotten a flu shot — a lower rate than the same time last year — while about 18% had received an rsv vaccine.  more nursing home residents need protection from rsv  covid-19  and flu  the report said. nursing home leadership and staff can talk to residents and their loved ones about the benefits and safety of vaccines.  the positive trend described in both reports  however  is a rise in rsv vaccinations  which increased among nursing home residents from less than 7% in mid-november last year to nearly 18% this year. the first rsv vaccine was approved for older adults in 2023 and the cdc said people age 75 and older should get the shot.  the rsv vaccine is a single-dose shot — not an annual one — and is also recommended for those 60 and up with an increased risk of severe illness.  to protect infants  who are also more likely to get dangerously ill from an rsv infection  the cdc recommends a vaccine given to pregnant mothers  or an antibody shot for babies after birth.  since june  rsv vaccine coverage among people ages 75 and older rose from 30% to nearly 40%  the cdc reported  and the rate in people ages 60 to 74 increased from 23% to just over 31%.,Health,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaccination-rates-flu-covid-low-cdc-rcna181217

10,With dengue cases at an extreme high  research points to climate change's role,it has been an exceptionally bad year for dengue fever: nearly 12 million cases were recorded in the americas through october  close to triple last year’s total of 4.6 million.  research being presented at the annual meeting of the american society of tropical medicine and hygiene on saturday quantifies the role that climate change has played in the trend  attributing nearly a fifth of the existing dengue burden to rising temperatures.  by 2050  the research predicts  climate change could be responsible for a 60% increase in the incidence of dengue if emissions continue at pace  with some places — like parts of peru  mexico  bolivia and brazil — seeing spikes of up to 200%.  public health experts have long warned that global warming enables mosquito-borne diseases to spread to new places because it expands the geographic range where the insects that serve as vectors live and thrive. mallory harris  a co-author of the new research and a postdoctoral associate in the university of maryland’s biology department  said her team’s findings build evidence for the significant role climate change has played in dengue’s spread. more broadly  she said  the research highlights the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and specific health consequences.  “dengue is a growing health threat that can cause really severe consequences. it’s something that we need to be preparing for ” harris said. “we should be expecting these sorts of large epidemics in the future and thinking about ways to then respond to them.”  in the united states and its territories  more than 7 200 dengue cases have been tallied so far this year — more than double last year’s total and the highest since 2013.  in june  the centers for disease control and prevention issued a health advisory warning of an increased risk of dengue infections. after two locally acquired cases were detected in the florida keys  the monroe county department of health issued an alert of its own the next month. to date  53 locally acquired cases — meaning they were not associated with travel to a country where dengue is prevalent — have been recorded in florida  according to the cdc. california has recorded 15 such cases.  but the vast majority of u.s. cases this year have been in puerto rico  which declared a public health emergency in march amid an alarming rise in dengue infections. more than 4 500 locally acquired dengue cases have been reported in puerto rico  compared to less than 1 300 last year and even fewer the year before.   the new research  which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed  analyzed temperature records and incidence data on dengue across 21 countries in asia and the americas over an average of 11 years. the researchers compared the data to a simulation of what would have happened during that time period without human-caused climate change.  the resulting estimates are likely at the low end of the spectrum  according to a news release about the findings  because of a lack of dengue data from some areas  such as sub-saharan africa and south asia. plus  predictions for the southern u.s. are difficult to make  given that the virus has only recently emerged as a local threat.  the researchers found that the mosquitoes that carry dengue — called aedes aegypti — transmit the virus most efficiently when temperatures are between 68 and 82 degrees fahrenheit. they concluded that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced  the majority of the countries analyzed would still see climate-driven increases in dengue.  recommended  women's health a few bursts of vigorous movement a day may cut women's heart risks  study says  health news mcdonald's e. coli outbreak is over  cdc says “the risks of this are going to increase regardless  so we need to be thinking about mitigation ” harris said  suggesting a focus on vaccines and efforts to curb mosquito populations.  the maker of the only food and drug administration-approved vaccine for dengue discontinued it earlier this year  according to the cdc.  more than half of people who contract dengue  a viral fever  are asymptomatic. most of the rest experience mild cases  with symptoms that can include a fever  headache  joint pain  nausea and vomiting. severe infections — about 2% of cases in u.s. territories from 2010 to 2020  according to the cdc — can cause bleeding under the skin  in the nose or in urine or stool  as well as a sudden drop in blood pressure or even death.  the disease is most common in places with humid  tropical climates across latin america.  derek cummings  a professor of epidemiology at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health who was not involved in the new research  said it takes “something that we all knew — that the temperature is important — but quantifies how much and how important it is to the changes we’re seeing.”  cummings  who has published his own research on dengue  added that on a global scale  he foresees a need to prioritize vaccinates  better manage mosquito populations and ensure hospitals and health care providers prepare for a rise in dengue cases.  harris emphasized that the new research shows how climate change’s consequences affect various parts of the world differently.  “the greatest impacts of historic climate change on dengue burden were in places like peru  bolivia  mexico  which are not necessarily the places that are the overall hottest. they’re not necessarily the places that are having the greatest increases in heat deaths ” she said. “there are effects that you might experience in places that are marginally cooler that also need to be taken into account.”,Health,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dengue-fever-climate-change-rcna179629
11,Is SpaceX's Starship the loudest ever rocket?,spacex's enormous starship rocket is the largest to ever successfully leave the launchpad. the massive thrust needed to launch it creates a lot of noise – but is it the loudest rocket ever?  watch footage of the saturn v launches during nasa's apollo programme in the 1960s and 1970s  and one thing that may strike you – even more than the polyester-heavy fashions and retro haircuts – is just how far away the crowds of onlookers are from the main event.  there were several good reasons for this  and noise was one of them: loud sounds can kill  and few things built by humans have been as loud as the saturn v.  when apollo astronauts blasted off on their missions to the moon  they did so with more than 3.2 miles (5.1km) separating them from the excited  onlooking crowds. even at such distances  the noise was incredible. a common myth at the time was that the soundwaves from the saturn v's engines were so powerful that they melted concrete on the launch pad and set fire to grass a mile (1.6km) away (both were false).   nasa's measurements at the time captured the launch noise at 204 decibels. compare that to the sound of a jet airliner taking off  which is between 120 and 160 decibels and considered dangerous to hearing if endured for longer than 30 seconds. even 1.5 miles (2.4km) away  the noise from a saturn v launch was recorded as being 120 decibels – as loud as a rock concert  or a car horn at very close quarters.   i'm always struck by the physicality of a launch  says anthony rue  a florida café owner who has been watching and photographing launches since the days of saturn v. back in the 1970s there was an audio device called sensurround that was used in disaster movies like earthquake to create a subsonic seismic 'experience' in the theatre.    0:45 watch: elon musk’s starship launched with a roar  but exploded after a failed separation in april 2023 launches  from up close  are a bit like sensurround  says rue. you can feel a slight tremble  then a building rumble in your chest before you can hear any actual sound. the subsonic bass frequencies make your ears crackle. after a few seconds  the sound coalesces into a roar  like a massive welding torch.  last year  a team of scientists from brigham young university in utah calculated just how loud saturn v was. they came up with a remarkably similar finding to nasa's own recordings – 203 decibels.  the difference between 160 and 200-odd decibels might not sound like a lot in the grand scheme of things  but it is.   one hundred and seventy decibels would be equivalent to 10 aircraft engines. two hundred would be 10 000 engines  said kent gee  leader author of the study and professor of physics at the brigham young university at the time. every 10 decibels is an order-of-magnitude increase.  was saturn v the loudest rocket ever launched? probably not  if you use thrust as your guide. the 35mn (meganewtons) of force produced by saturn v at launch is less than that produced by the soviet union's ill-fated n1 rocket (45mn) which was supposed to have delivered cosmonauts to the lunar surface in the 1960s.  the 33 engines at the base of the super heavy booster on spacex's starship – the largest rocket to ever take off – produce more than 74mn of thrust. on paper at least  it should be louder than anything launched before it. certainly  it is pretty loud. gee and his colleagues set up microphones at eight sites around the spacex launch facility in boca chica during the fifth test flight in october 2024  when the super heavy booster also landed back on the launchpad for the first time. they found that during the launch  the rocket produced noise that reached more than 120db more than 6.5 miles (10.5km) away. a sonic boom produced as the booster returned towards the launchpad generated almost 140db at the same distance.   the overall noise produced a starship launch at that distance was equivalent to standing just 200ft (61m) from a large passenger aircraft such as a 747 or a380. gee and his colleagues describe the sound produced by a rocket launch as low-frequency rumble with transitory crackles. the noise of the starship launch set off car alarms in towns upto 10 miles (16km) away.   while it is hard to know for sure how the noise produced by the saturn v would have compared  it was certainly loud enough that there was more to consider than just the hearing of spectators. rockets as powerful as saturn v were capable of causing damage to themselves just from the soundwaves generated from the noise of their own launch.   i'm about a half mile away  i've got earplugs in and for 600 seconds  this thing is producing just more steam than you can imagine – john blevins making sure that damage didn't happen preoccupied nasa's rocket engineers even before the apollo programme  says nasa's john blevins  chief engineer of the space launch system (sls) used for the recent artemis programme launch.  one solution: the fire trenches in the launch pad are filled with water which helps muffle some of the intense noise created when the rocket lifts off.  there's a series of ground tests that we did back in the apollo days  we did them again for space launch system  says blevins  adding that nasa also built smaller models of both the rocket and the pads to gauge how their interactions produced noise. the maximum noise for the rocket itself  although you might not be able to tell if you're sitting at banana creek [a popular site for viewing launches]  is actually about 150ft (45m) off the ground; the plume is spread out  instead of going down a hole that has the water in it  that helps attenuate some of that noise.  the biggest rocket ever launched  the starship rocket  built by elon musk's spacex  became the largest and most powerful rocket system to ever take off when it launched on its brief maiden flight on 20 april 2023 moments before it underwent an unscheduled disassembly while in mid-air. the 120m (393ft) tall rocket is designed to have almost double the thrust of any rocket in history.   analysis conducted by the us federal aviation administration (faa) prior to starship's launch estimated the super heavy rocket system would produce up to 150db in the area just outside the boca chica launch facility in texas. people up to eight miles (13km) away  including those living in nearby port isabel  will hear the roar of the rocket at a level of 120db  while those in eastern brownsville around 15 miles (24km) away will experience noise levels of 111db – around the same as being at a live rock concert. measurements taken during the fifth test flight of starship by researchers at brigham young university showed that the maximum noise produced were close to these preditions.  the faa warned the engines may even be loud enough to damage to nearby buildings. residents in port isabel reported doors and windows shaking  and one gym owner claimed his window shattered during one starship launch  according to the new york times. dust and debris kicked up by the rocket also rained down on the town and the launchpad itself was destroyed by the force of the rocket.    the water-filled fire trenches were also used for the space shuttle launch – the charismatic  boiling clouds of vapour seen in those famous old nasa rocket launches are not in fact smoke  but steam from the water vaporising from the intense heat.  you might also like:  inside nasa's giant rocket factory artemis i: a giant rocket to set records the genius behind early russian space tech the sls is the new rocket used in the artemis programme – the one planned to take humanity further into the solar system than ever before. it became one of the most powerful rockets ever launched with 15% more thrust than saturn v. as the sls chief engineer  blevins has watched – and heard – its five engines being ground tested at the john c stennis space center in southern mississippi. the ground tests are a critical step in a rocket design's progress  says blevins.  i'm about a half mile away  i've got earplugs in and for 600 seconds  this thing is producing just more steam than you can imagine. and when you can get that close  you see that's one engine out of four! and those produce less thrust than the two [solid rocket boosters] on the side.     it gives you an idea just how powerful these rockets are. it's just amazing.    1:00 watch: footage from the artemis i launch from november 2022 blevins says the sls is designed to be quieter than saturn v  but that noise levels are dependent on more than just the engine's thrust.   there's a lot of nuances to what the people hear  says blevins. like a low cloudy day  like if you had a 1 000ft (330m) cloud ceiling  that noise will travel all the way across the state of florida and just bounce back and forth. it really won't be easily attenuated and so people in tampa will hear a rocket launch if you have a little overcast day. tampa is three hours' drive away from the kennedy space center  on the other side of the florida peninsula.  a study by scientists at brigham young university and rollins college in florida studied recordings from the sls during the artemis 1 launch in november 2022 found it made more noise than pre-launch models had predicted. they found at 0.9 miles (1.5km) from the launchpad  the maximum noise level reached 136 decibels while at 3.2 miles (5.2km) it was 129 decibels.    whitney coyle  a mathematician at rollins college who studies acoustics and was one of those who examined the sound coming from the artemis 1 launch  described the crackling sound the sls produced as being 40 million times greater than a bowl of rice krispies.  noisier rockets may be on the cards though. spacex's starship vehicle – intended for a proposed mission to mars – took off on top of the company's super heavy booster on its brief maiden flight on 20 april 2023 amid a huge plume of flame and smoke. super heavy can  according to spacex  generate nearly 76mn of thrust  more than twice that of saturn v. spacex's engineers now have to figure out why the rocket underwent a mid-air unscheduled disassembly shortly after take-off before the giant rocket will fly again. but if you're planning on watching its next launch  earplugs sound like a very good idea.,Technology,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230306-just-how-loud-is-a-rocket-launch
12,'My vacuum cleaner exploded while it was charging',a surrey woman has warned about the dangers of lithium-ion batteries after an explosion at her home.  denise graovac from thames ditton told bbc radio surrey she had left a handheld vacuum cleaner charging unattended in her garage when her daughter heard a loud bang.  there was a fire in my garage  said denise  adding the device had totally melted.  surrey fire and rescue service (sfrs) said it had seen a rise in battery-related fires over the past five years  with 55 incidents since september alone.     4:17 denise graovac's vacuum cleaner exploded with a loud bang. the service compared this with 53 incidents in the whole of 2023  20 in 2022 and 13 in 2021.  lithium-ion batteries are found in smartphones  laptops  e-bikes and electric vehicles.  they can pose a serious fire risk if damaged  mishandled  or charged incorrectly  and old batteries can sometimes spontaneously combust without warning.  ms graovac said: be very careful what you leave plugged in.  they can explode at any time and they can cause loss of property and even possibly loss of life.  you’ve got to be aware of what you’ve got in your house because they can be dangerous.   an sfrs spokesperson said the number of incidents could rise year-on-year with the increased use of lithium-ion batteries in everyday household items.  it said fires caused by the batteries can spread quickly and be difficult to extinguish.  it advised people not to overcharge them  to store them safely  inspect them for damage and dispose of them properly.  station commander  steve love said: lithium-ion batteries come with risks.  by taking raising awareness  we hope to reduce the number of incidents.,Technology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8vnq20npjo
13,LinkedIn: We're too boring for kids for social media ban,career-networking site linkedin has told australian lawmakers it is too dull for kids to warrant its inclusion in a proposed ban on social media for under 16 year olds.  linkedin simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors  the microsoft-owned company said in a submission to an australian senate committee.  the australian government has said it will introduce world-leading legislation to stop children accessing social media platforms.  but companies behind some of the most popular platforms with young people - meta  google  snapchat-owner snap inc and tiktok - have all challenged the planned law in submissions made to lawmakers.   australia wants to ban kids from social media. will it work? prime minister anthony albanese has said the proposed law is to address the harm social media was inflicting on australian children.  he said it was for the mums and dads who like him were worried sick about the safety of our kids online.  other countries are closely watching what happens with the legislation with some - including the uk - saying they are open to following suit.  australia's senate environment and communications legislation committee gave respondents one day to comment on the bill  which would amend its existing online safety act.  its report to the senate concludes the bill should pass - providing its recommendations  such as engaging young people in the legislation's implementation  are considered.   'significant concerns' however  in their responses  the world's biggest tech firms have been setting out why they are unhappy with the proposed law.  google - which owns youtube - and instagram-parent meta have said they needed more time to consider the legislation.  meta said its current form will fail to achieve its goal of reducing the burden on parents to manage the safety of young people on social media.  it also claimed it ignores the evidence presented by child safety and mental health experts - a view shared by snapchat in its own submission.  x (formerly twitter)  meanwhile questioned the legality of the bill's proposals.  tiktok australia said it had significant concerns with the bill as proposed.  like other platforms commenting on the legislation  it said it hinges on an ongoing age assurance trial looking at technologies that can effectively check user age.  ella woods-joyce  director of public policy for tiktok australia and new zealand  wrote in the company's submission that the bill's rushed passage poses a serious risk of further unintended consequences.  but linkedin has adopted a different approach - arguing in its submission that is a platform which is simply not of any interest to children.  its minimum age requirement of 16 means they cannot access it  the company said  adding it removes child accounts when found.  if linkedin can successfully argue it should not be included in the legislation it will potentially avoid the cost and disruption involved it introducing additional age verification processes to the site.  subjecting linkedin’s platform to regulation under the proposed legislation would create unnecessary barriers and costs for linkedin’s members in australia to undertake age assurance  it said.  interest elsewhere the australian government has said it wants to bring in the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year.  but experts have said the bill's timeframe and current composition fails to provide an opportunity for adequate scrutiny.  carly kind  the country's privacy commissioner  said in a linkedin post on monday after appearing at a public senate hearing that she was concerned by the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban.  human rights commissioner lorraine findlay called the one-day window for submissions of responses to the legislation entirely inadequate in a linkedin post on thursday.  we need actual consultation  not just the appearance of it  she said.  nonetheless  the australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere.  in the uk  the technology secretary  peter kyle  told the bbc this month that similar legislation was on the table.  france has already introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent- though research indicates almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple vpn.  social media,Technology,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dz2z72y8o

15,US to Introduce New Restrictions on China’s Access to Cutting-Edge Chips,the biden administration is expected to announce a sweeping set of measures on monday designed to further restrain china’s ability to develop advanced artificial intelligence  people familiar with the matter told wired. the controls could include sanctioning dozens of chinese companies that produce equipment for making semiconductors  as well as placing restrictions on a handful of chip manufacturing plants  some of which have ties to the chinese tech giant huawei.  the us department of commerce has also discussed including controls on the sale of high-bandwidth memory  or hbm  an advanced kind of 3d-stacked computer memory component that is often used in high-performance gpus and customized ai chips. bloomberg previously reported that the biden administration was considering clamping down on china’s access to hbm chips.  in total  the biden administration could end up adding around 200 chinese firms to an entity list maintained by the bureau of industry and security—an agency within the commerce department—which would require other companies to acquire special licenses to supply them with software or products from the united states. the us government has been discussing the new measures with its allies and representatives from the semiconductor industry for months  and the exact details of what will be announced on monday were still in flux as of earlier this week.  a spokesperson for the commerce department declined to comment. huawei did not immediately return a request for comment.  reuters reported on friday that the us chamber of commerce  a powerful advocacy group for american businesses  warned its members in an email last week that a new round of export controls targeting china would be arriving “prior to the thanksgiving break  though that timing now appears to have been pushed back by a few days.  “china is firmly opposed to the us overstretching the concept of national security  abusing export control measures and making malicious attempts to block and suppress china ” mao ning  a spokesperson for china’s foreign ministry  said at a regularly scheduled press conference earlier this week in response to the anticipated controls.  the limits on china’s access to the high-bandwidth memory seem aimed at slowing the country’s efforts to develop domestic chips capable of training very large and powerful ai models. the new restrictions are expected to block access to hmb3  one of the people told wired  the latest and most advanced version of the technology  and impose some limits on access to the previous generation  known as hmb2.  most popular gear best housewarming gifts for any new home by nena farrell gear top wayfair coupons for december 2024 by molly higgins gear save big with these canon coupons for december 2024 by scott gilbertson security the pressure is on for big tech to regulate the broken digital advertising industry by claire atkin the us government has been imposing similar export controls on china aimed at limiting its ability to mint advanced silicon for years  but the controls apparently didn’t stop huawei from developing competitive chips for training large ai models.  the chinese tech giant  which was temporarily crippled by us sanctions half a decade ago  sent samples of its latest ai training chip  called ascend  to customers this september  according to the south china morning post. companies testing ascend reportedly include bytedance  the chinese parent of tiktok  which is said to be training a large model primarily using ascend. baidu  which makes china’s leading search engine and has developed autonomous driving systems  recently placed an order for huawei’s chips in a shift away from us chip giant nvidia  according to reuters. (nvidia declined to comment.)  export restrictions aimed at curbing china’s ai sector began under the first trump administration. in 2019  several up-and-coming chinese ai firms were added to the entity list  meaning that us firms  including chipmakers like nvidia  would be required to get a special license to do business with them. this was followed by restrictions on sales of chips made with us technology to huawei  china’s dominant telco and a leading smartphone manufacturer.  the biden administration ratcheted up the controls in october 2022  limiting exports to china of cutting-edge gpu chips  including those made by nvidia  a move aimed at curbing any chinese company’s ability to train the most powerful ai models. the rules were tightened a year later to close loopholes that still allowed chinese firms to access some advanced chips.  it can be tricky to gauge the impact of us chip sanctions  and some experts question whether the controls are spurring china to make more rapid advances in chipmaking itself  reducing its reliance on american companies.  in late 2023  huawei unveiled the mate 60  a smartphone featuring an advanced chip from the chinese chipmaker smic. the announcement caused a stir in washington  because it suggested that smic had made substantial progress in advancing its own manufacturing techniques. (further analysis indicated that huawei and smic were still reliant on foreign suppliers.)  but a report published this week by the center for strategic and international studies  a washington  dc-based think tank  argued that the chinese government had already begun ramping up investment in domestic chipmaking before the us government began clamping down on the country’s access to advanced semiconductors. it also noted that china has made bigger strides in sectors not subject to export controls  such as solar cell and electric vehicle manufacturing.,Technology,https://www.wired.com/story/memory-restrictions-china-advanced-chips/
16,Cybertruck’s Many Recalls Make It Worse Than 91 Percent of All 2024 Vehicles,cybertruck ownershave discovered that a chunk of these stainless steel electric pickups could “stop producing torque” while thrumming along. the fault was noted by tesla in a november 5 national highway traffic safety administration recall. any sudden loss of propulsion might “increase the risk of a collision ” added the filing ominously. the latest recall—the wedge wagon’s sixth this year—requires shop time  not an over-the-air (ota) update.  reports of instantaneous loss of e-horsepower due to duff drive inverters—devices that convert dc to ac and control an ev’s motor speed and torque—might alarm the average ev motorist  but to extrovert buyers of elon musk’s flagship  it’s evidence of the angular pickup’s edginess  ivan drury  the director of insights at car shopping guide edmunds  told wired.  “the people drawn to [the cybertruck] don’t have quality of construction or safety at the top of mind ” he says. “that this could be a dangerous vehicle to drive is key to its appeal. nobody’s buying it to use as an actual truck.”  stomping on the accelerator pedals of the affected cybertrucks might get their drivers nowhere—a downer  you’d think  for a vehicle that’s faster to 60 mph than a lamborghini aventador—but  adds the hawaii-based drury  that won’t harm the pickup’s reputation with many wannabe owners.  “the more the press and others say it’s bad  the more that [typical cybertruck customers] see it as good ” says drury.  mocked online as the cyberbrick  the car launched in december 2023; tesla had apparently sold 27 000 of them by october this year  as could be inferred by the number of cybertrucks listed on the fifth recall. some 2 431 cybertrucks were affected by the sixth recall  requiring vehicle drop-off for new drive inverters to be fitted.  the recalled drive inverters—equipped with potentially faulty metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors—were fitted to cybertrucks manufactured between november of last year and the end of july this year.  “it’s common for all-new models to have increased recalls in the first year after launch ” karl brauer  executive analyst at car ranking service iseecars  tells wired. “where it gets interesting ” brauer added  “is how quickly this initial spate of recalls falls off after launch versus continuing as the years pass.”  most popular gear the hisense px3-pro is our favorite short throw projector by parker hall gear sony's mdr-m1 are excellent wired studio headphones by terrence o’brien gear carv 2 digital coach is the best ski teacher money can buy by chris haslam gear the new mac mini is tinier and more capable than ever by brenda stolyar and on this metric  the cybertruck might be wanting. “cars with ongoing recalls well after launch suggest a much higher lifetime recall total ” says brauer. he calculates that the cybertruck’s six recalls to date are “worse than 91 percent” of other 2024 vehicles. all this was possibly foreshadowed in 2023 when a leaked tesla report showed the cybertruck had basic design flaws.  “we aren’t comfortable making [lifetime recall] predictions on the cybertruck at this very early stage ” stresses brauer  “but so far it isn’t doing very well.”  most cybertruck buyers pay scant attention to longevity estimates  believes edmunds’ drury  and plenty probably aren’t exercised by recalls  ota or otherwise  he said. “cybertruck customers are in it for the stares and glares—they don’t care about how many times [this vehicle is] going to be recalled over 30 years ” says drury. “they’re buying this car for now  with zero thought to the future.”  “a standard auto customer wants to know if a car will last 10 years or will be ongoing good value for money ” he says. “a cybertruck customer doesn’t care about any of that. owning a cybertruck isn’t practical; it’s a boast. a boast that ‘i have so much discretionary income i can afford to waste it on an impractical car.’”  similar to other critics (earlier this year  a cnn reviewer called the pickup a “disturbing level of individual arrogance in hard  unforgiving steel”)  drury believes cybertruck buyers are people “who think  ‘i don’t care if i kill people when i drive this thing down the street ’” he says. “there aren’t many of those people out there  so there’s a relatively small market for the cybertruck.”  if tesla  which was contacted for this piece  is genuinely fishing in smaller pools than originally anticipated by musk—at a 2023 shareholder meeting he predicted that cybertruck sales could hit 250 000 by 2025  and reach 500 000 a year once production ramped up—this might help explain the softening of cybertruck aftersales.  “used values on these things have plummeted dramatically ” said drury. price tracking website cargurus estimates that the average used cybertruck dropped from $175 000 in april to $110 864 today. the cheapest cybertruck on autotrader was $86 000 earlier this week  and many of the other 276 currently listed on the site sport “recent price drop” banners.  most popular gear the hisense px3-pro is our favorite short throw projector by parker hall gear sony's mdr-m1 are excellent wired studio headphones by terrence o’brien gear carv 2 digital coach is the best ski teacher money can buy by chris haslam gear the new mac mini is tinier and more capable than ever by brenda stolyar aftermarket prices might soften further as tesla is starting to deliver a new $79 990 model to reservation holders. not that there’s any longer much need to place reservations—north american tesla stores now accept walk-in orders for cybertrucks  with delivery two or three weeks later. “i am calling it: original reservation list is basically finished ” said reservationist bayoucitybob on a cybertruck owners forum last month. tesla had claimed to have banked more than 1 million $100 prelaunch reservations for the cybertruck.  “i was thinking i have to wait a couple of [years] before my time comes ” mc1987 responded to bayoucitybob  citing his invitation to purchase his second cybertruck.

17,England close on victory in first Test against New Zealand,england are on course for victory in the first test against new zealand after chris woakes' crucial two wickets in two balls on the third day in christchurch.  the tourists had built a first-innings lead of 151 and threatened to overrun the kiwis by reducing them to 64-3 before kane williamson launched a rescue act.  williamson looked immovable and ominous for his 61  only for woakes to deliver a potentially decisive blow.  a nip-backer earned a marginal lbw decision and  next ball  tom blundell feathered to ollie pope.  when brydon carse got his third wicket  glenn phillips lbw  new zealand were left 155-6  just four runs ahead.  the black caps are in a mess of their own making. they took their total of dropped catches to eight with another two on saturday.  harry brook was put down for a fifth time on his way to 171  the highest score by an overseas batter in a test at hagley oval. his average of 89.40 in away tests is bettered only by sir donald bradman.  brook added 159 with ben stokes  the england captain's 80 his best in test cricket since the summer of 2023.  stokes played a supporting role as he shared 63 and 40 with gus atkinson and carse respectively  taking england to 499.  'welcome back  ben stokes  in all sorts of ways' published 3 days ago england squeeze wasteful new zealand where might this test be had new zealand not wasted wickets in their first innings and  more importantly  held at least some of their catches? it has been an unusually sloppy performance from the kiwis.  williamson  who became the first new zealander to reach 9 000 test runs  was promising a repeat of wellington 2023  when his 132 engineered a historic one-run win after england made new zealand follow on.  woakes seemed an unlikely source of english inspiration. to that point he endured a poor match: wicketless in the first innings  out second ball and then watching atkinson and carse show they can provide lower-order runs.  his intervention was high in both drama and skill. instead of the end of the day being a chance for new zealand to build a handy lead  it became a battle to survive.  england still have work to do with the ball. when they do eventually come to a run-chase it will be on a surface that is getting better for batting.  new zealand-england contests are rarely straightforward and this one may have more twists  but the tourists are heavy favourites from here.  stokes in the slipstream ben stokes bats image source getty images image caption  ben stokes was batting at number seven for only the third time in 2024 - his previous scores being 54 against west indies and 11 against india  england were 319-5 overnight  29 behind  and faced the second new ball six overs into the day. stokes charged at tim southee when he sent down the first delivery with it  then settled into the slipstream of brook  atkinson and carse.  even before the new ball  brook had been dropped again. on adding 15 to his 132  he was missed by gully phillips off will o'rourke and threw his eyes to the heavens in disbelief.  reprieved  brook hit southee on to the roof of the pavilion then played a tired poke at matt henry. woakes' wafted drive at southee left england seven down and only 34 ahead.  while stokes was steady - his strike-rate of 54.8 was the third-slowest score of 80 or more by any england batter since he became captain - atkinson and carse were explosive.  atkinson clobbered anything short in his 48 from 36 balls. carse  one of the most capable number 10s england have had  belted 33 not out after giving the eighth and most difficult chance to a diving phillips running back from point.  stokes and shoaib bashir left henry with 4-84  stokes falling 20 short of a fairytale century in the city of his birth.  wizard woakes winkles williamson wicket kane williamson walks off after being dismissed image source getty images image caption  kane williamson averages 67 in 50 tests in new zealand  new zealand captain tom latham shelled three of the drops and his fortune did not improve with an edge off woakes to second slip brook for one. atkinson rubbed salt into kiwi wounds with a fine swoop at mid-on to pouch devon conway's miscued pull at carse.  carse has been exceptional since making his test debut in pakistan. pacey and capable of generating awkward bounce  he is reminiscent of fellow durham man steve harmison.  from carse's first ball after tea  rachin ravindra was suckered into a pull  only finding jacob bethell at deep mid-wicket. stokes  the architect of the plan  was celebrating before the catch was taken.  despite the peril  the unflappable williamson continued from his 93 in the first innings. he toyed with the field by delicately dabbing to third man and  along with daryl mitchell  got after bashir.  new zealand's momentum was building  woakes was summoned. wide of the crease  he got enough movement in for williamson to fail in the tightest review. next ball  delivered from close to the stumps  nipped just enough for blundell to tickle.  phillips survived the hat-trick ball only to be pinned to the crease by carse for another marginal lbw. mitchell  31 not out  appears to be new zealand's last hope.,Sports,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cz0m0ln43mxo
18,A unique  controversial character and player,the very first time we saw him play  i remember this player just flying past us down the touchline and us both going  'woah! who is that?' thinking it was a wing – it was a prop  and it was joe marler.  three six nations championships  95 england caps  and two premiership titles later  marler's 15-year career has come to an end.  the 34-year-old announced his surprise decision to retire on wednesday  saying it was time to finally jump off that rollercoaster in a joint statement with harlequins.  bbc rugby union commentators sara orchard and andy rowley have followed his career closely since that day he raced past them on the touchline as an unknown young player.  as marler prepared to make his final appearance for harlequins in friday's defeat by bristol  they reflected on the many ups  downs  twists and turns on that rollercoaster.  a 'new generation' of prop for england harlequins prop joe marler in action. image source getty images image caption  marler won two premiership titles with harlequins  as well as the european challenge cup  circa 2008 to 2010  orchard and rowley were working on a bbc radio london rugby programme called the scrum and attended a local derby between esher and richmond-based london scottish.  orchard is now a bbc sport and bbc radio 5 live rugby union commentator and regularly covers england internationals  while rowley commentates on harlequins games for bbc radio london.  and the two of them were blown away by the speed and technical ability they saw from the young prop marler  who had a dual registration with harlequins and esher at the time.  unbelievable – the pace. he's transformed a lot  but at that time he was so quick  rowley says.  how good his hands were throughout his career. him and the likes of [fellow ex-england prop] mako vunipola  were distributers  and that was pretty new for props to be that good [with their hands].  and people playing with him at that time knew he was going to be that good from that early age.  marler made his quins debut in 2009 and three years later was wearing the white of england when he made his debut on a tour of south africa  fresh off the back of winning his first premiership title.  he is a controversial character  there's no two ways about it and some people will probably dislike him  but in the same breath there will be people who absolutely adore and love him  orchard says.  he was one of a new generation of props where we'd moved away from that world cup era of england winning in 2003 and the hulking ‘dad’s army’. we were moving into an era where you needed more from a prop.  and that was what joe marler did; young as he was  he probably didn't even realise he was doing it at that point. it's no surprise he went on to play for england as long as he did.  joe marler [left] and tom johnson train ahead of their full international debuts for england. image source getty images image caption  marler made his england debut in 2012 on a tour of south africa  during a stellar international career  marler racked up 95 caps  won the six nations three times - including the grand slam in 2016 - and was part of the england side that reached the 2019 world cup final in japan  losing 32-12 to the springboks in yokohama.  in paris last year  england again tasted defeat at the hands of the same opposition at the semi-final stage  with a world cup winners' medal ultimately evading him as he announced his international retirement soon after.  he has been a core part of harlequins' first two premiership title wins in the club's history in 2011-12 and nine years later in 2020-21.  marler's final game for the club came against bristol  the opponents for quins' famous bristanbul comeback victory three years ago in the semi-final.  having been flown to the game at ashton gate in a helicopter after the birth of his child  marler played the full match plus extra time as quins came from 28-0 down to triumph 43-36 on their way to claiming the league trophy.  there's joe marler on the field  which is [an] incredible scrummager  and what i think he'll be renowned for. but also  we have to talk about him off-field  don't we  orchard says.  a big personality on and off the pitch joe marler poses for a selfie with harlequins fans. image source getty images image caption  marler has been a hugely popular player with harlequins supporters  while success has been at the forefront of marler's long career  controversy hasn't been far behind.  he's described himself in the past as a pantomime villain on the pitch.  there's no denying that the reason we're talking about him with the affection  or some will say they think it's disdain  is because of what he's offered away from the rugby pitch  orchard says.  i have to say – what a character. the sport needs people like this  don't they?  rowley adds: you can't ignore him  can you? but he has  i imagine  been quite difficult to manage at times.  in 2016  he was banned for two matches and fined by world rugby for calling samson lee a gypsy boy in england's six nations clash with wales.  he received a 10-week ban for grabbing the genitals of captain alun wyn jones against the same opposition in 2020.  last month  he was again criticised for a social post that said the ridiculous haka needs binning  which he later apologised for.  a lot of people think that that's a bit of fun  saying that the haka has to be binned by new zealand and that they shouldn't have what some perceive as competitive advantage  orchard says.  it's also considered incredibly insulting to the whole maori culture. it's described as a cultural challenge for a reason  the haka  and it should be respected.  therefore  a flippant comment on social media often does not go down well  no matter how light-hearted someone might think that this actually is. so that's where joe does often get into a lot of trouble.  'he knows he's not the perfect human being' joe marler grabs alun wyn jones in a crowd of players. image source getty images image caption  marler was given a 10-week ban for grabbing alun wyn jones' genitals during a match between england and wales in 2020  marler is an active user of social media and has his own podcast. his distinctive personality has led to him appearing as a celebrity expert on michael mcintyre's bbc tv game show the wheel as his profile has continued to grow away from the field.  he has also been a vocal advocate for promoting mental health  opening up on his own struggles  which led to him withdrawing from england contention  in a documentary called big boys don't cry.  and shining a light on that vulnerability is something orchard describes as a massive part of his legacy.  he's really put that on the map. i really think that side of joe has been so important for the sport  she says.  and you hope so many people have learned from his example of talking about these things.  he knows he's not the perfect human being.  'he divides opinion but is a special  unique rugby player' marler arrives at harlequins training at surrey sports park  in guildford  on a scooter. image source getty images image caption  marler arrives at harlequins training at surrey sports park  in guildford  on a scooter  when announcing his retirement  marler thanked the harlequins fanbase for the patience  support and kindness they have given him  even when he hasn't felt he has deserved it and they could have turned their back on him  he said.  but the days of the mohawk and beard-sporting  onesie-wearing big man arriving at training and matches on a scooter are now over.  on friday  the charismatic prop donned the famous quarters and crossed the whitewash at the stoop for the final time when quins returned to premiership action following the autumn international break.  but with the growth of his media presence in recent years  rugby fans will expect to see plenty more of the former england man after he leaves the pitch.  when it comes to joe  he's got the bravery  orchard adds.  we've got so many sanitised sportsmen and women out there who just say what they think is the party line – joe's never done that.  everyone will miss him. but that's not to say he's still going to be in the headlines because he's still got a social media account  and he's going to use it.  he can divide opinion  but he has been a very special  unique rugby union player – and i think that's the biggest thing everyone will take from his career.,Sports,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c207xjrrp6po

20,Meet the man spearheading Jake Paul’s divisive boxing career,to some  he’s the promoter behind the fight that “broke the internet” – the man responsible for bringing the controversial bout between jake paul and mike tyson to an audience of millions.  but nakisa bidarian has referred to himself as “just an accountant” alongside his business partner paul  the former youtuber who defeated tyson in last week’s underwhelming but widely-watched contest.  bidarian and paul co-founded most valuable promotions in 2021  and on friday  their company hosted its biggest event to date in front of 73 200 fans at a sold-out at&t stadium in arlington  texas.   jake paul announced as winner against mike tyson during live on netflix: jake paul vs. mike tyson at at&t stadium on november 15  2024 in arlington  texas. related article ‘just sad ’ ‘wasn’t a good one’ and ‘trash’: mike tyson vs. jake paul fight leaves spectators disappointed  the main event itself was a lackluster affair  paul landing 78 total punches and tyson landing 18 of only 97 punches thrown. at the age of 58  31 years his opponent’s senior and nearly two decades on from his last professional bout  tyson was clearly a shadow of the heavyweight champion he used to be.  but bidarian still saw the night as an overwhelming success.  “jake had an ayahuasca session and envisioned this fight (against tyson) happening ” he told cnn sport after the fight. “ultimately  when we got here  you connected six different generations. from the original boomers that were born in the 1940s  to the demographic that is most passionate for jake paul – which is gen z and gen alpha – all taking about this same event.  “we had journalists calling us and saying that this was the first time that their mother  who is in her 70s or even early 80s  was talking to their son about a fight. that’s what made this special.”  for those tuning in  the viewing experience was hardly hitch-free. everyone became intimately familiar with the netflix loading screen after the massive viewership to watch the streaming platform’s first-ever live boxing bout crashed the server.  later  netflix announced that a record 60 million households tuned into the event  peaking at 65 million concurrent streams. then on tuesday  most valuable promotions said that the event made $18.1 million in total gate revenue  making it the biggest gate for any boxing or mma event outside of las vegas in us history  as well as the ninth-highest combat sports gate in us history.  paul (left) and tyson fight at at&t stadium in arlington  texas. paul (left) and tyson fight at at&t stadium in arlington  texas. al bello/getty images “the event broke the internet ” said bidarian. “there’s never been a streaming event of this magnitude in history.  “could we have made more money on pay-per-view? of course ” he added. “but that wasn’t the goal here. this was about legacy  this was about brand-building  this was about an iconic moment where the world stopped and got reintroduced to boxing.”  a road to the top bidarian has worked for numerous enterprises as an investor  advisor and financial consultant  including a period as chief financial officer for the ultimate fighting championship (ufc) up to 2016.  he first met paul through a mutual friend in october 2019 and would go on to advance the former youtuber’s boxing career.  “i executive produced mike tyson’s exhibition match against roy jones (in 2020) ” bidarian said. “i brought on jake paul as the co-feature of that event  and that’s where jake got his notoriety as a fairly novice  young boxer.”  paul earned a ko victory over former nba player nate robinson on the undercard of that event  propeling his boxing career to lucrative heights.  bidarian and paul formed most valuable promotions soon after  announcing seven-division women’s world champion amanda serrano as the company’s first signing.  “it was really based on three things ” bidarian told cnn in july about the reasons behind company’s creation. “one  the mindset of fighters first  really making fighters feel like they’re the focus  and they get the lion’s share of the revenue.  “two was wanting to double down on women. i had the experience in mma when ronda rousey rose to success and really trailblazed the sport. i believe the same thing can happen within boxing  and amanda was that vehicle  perfect athlete  perfect superstar in the making. third was giving young boxers a platform.”  nakisa bidarian (center) stands between tyson and paul ahead of last week's fight. nakisa bidarian (center) stands between tyson and paul ahead of last week's fight. brett carlsen/getty images while paul enjoys a flashy and lavish lifestyle – often posting pictures to social media in exotic cars and flying on a private jet with his girlfriend and olympian jutta leerdam – bidarian tends to operate away from the public eye.  and although paul’s fighting career has drawn criticism  with many condemning his bout against tyson as a low-quality encounter which was more about spectacle than sport  bidarian is adamant that the 27-year-old is a legitimate presence in boxing.  “first and foremost  he’s a dedicated boxer who has four years of professional experience … he’s already made more headway than any boxer has who had no amateur background in those four years ” bidarian said.  “the level of competition he’s fighting  the stage he’s fighting on  the amount of pressure on him is unprecedented.”  shift to women’s boxing in serrano  he and paul have the task of promoting one of the biggest names in women’s boxing.  the puerto rican’s light-welterweight unification bout against katie taylor was the most compelling match-up at friday’s event in texas  a repeat of the irish star’s victory at madison square garden two years ago.  taylor was triumphant again in the second instalment  though many in attendance booed in disbelief when the unanimous decision victory was announced. the two women put on a masterclass  serrano being the aggressor and taylor exploding forward with power shots  often clashing heads with her opponent.  in round eight  taylor was deducted a point after her fourth ruled headbutt. serrano had seemed to be in control but was blindsided by the decision  calling taylor a “dirty fighter.”  serrano (right) and taylor contest their thrilling rematch in texas. serrano (right) and taylor contest their thrilling rematch in texas. sarah stier/getty images bidarian nevertheless believes that serrano is left in a strong position  despite the defeat.  “i feel blessed that she actually lost ” he said. “i hate the decision  but i love the outcome. there was a trilogy that was pre-negotiated hadn’t katie taylor won. there is no trilogy now in place.  “amanda serrano is in the greatest position of her life. she is the face of women’s boxing. i think the whole world thought she won  and now she’s going to win in a way that no woman ever has in sports before  and that’s with her bank account because she deserves every bit of it.”,Sports,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/sport/nakisa-bidarian-jake-paul-boxing-spt-intl/index.html
21,‘Like climbing Mount Everest:’ Inside the grueling world of the Chess World Championship, ding liren slumped over the board with fallen chess pieces scattered in front of him in the moments after he won the chess world championship last year.  his head bowed  his expression blank  he seemed as if he was collecting himself after a brutal fight  still reeling from the blows his opponent ian nepomniachtchi had landed  wary to move in case his legs gave out under him.  the pair had been dueling each other for three weeks  maintaining a mind-boggling level of concentration during that time  for any momentary lapse could cost them the game.   the chess world championship is an extraordinary  singular event. its first edition was held 138 years ago but  in that time  just 17 players have become world champion. “chess demands total concentration ” bobby fischer  the only american ever to hold the title  once noted  and only those capable of maintaining that focus for weeks on end can achieve the biggest prize in the sport.  “it’s our mount olympus ” viswanathan “vishy” anand  a five-time world chess champion  tells cnn sport. “it’s the thing you spend a lot of time trying to achieve  aiming for  dreaming of  since you learned the game. it’s like climbing mount everest or crossing the amazon.”  on monday  this year’s edition of the grueling tournament will begin in singapore with china’s ding seeking to defend his title against india’s gukesh dommaraju  better known as gukesh d  who is still just 18 years old and could become the youngest ever person to be crowned world champion.  astana  kazakhstan - april 29: grandmaster ding liren (l) of china plays against grandmaster ian nepomniachtchi of russia during the 2023 world chess championship at the st regis astana hotel on april 29  2023 in astana  kazakhstan.

low past courtois from inside the area.  real madrid had the perfect opportunity to get back into the game just after the hour mark when andy robertson fouled lucas vàzquez in the area  but mbappé – who had a difficult evening – saw his penalty saved by caoimhin kelleher.  just under 10 minutes later  it was liverpool’s turn to pass up a golden chance  mohamed salah missing his own penalty after he was brought down by ferland mendy.  but the reds would not be denied as substitute cody gakpo headed in a robertson cross in the 76th minute to seal the win.  “it’s always good to win a game  and especially a big game because you know you face so many quality players ” said slot in his post-match press conference.  “if we arrive in the last 16 or quarterfinals or wherever we can arrive to  and face them again and then we’re able to beat them  that would be maybe a bigger statement than this. but we are definitely happy with the win.”  liverpool's cody gakpo scores his team's second goal to

24,Rafael Nadal: Farewell to the ‘King of Clay’,with tears in his eyes  rafael nadal said goodbye to professional tennis on tuesday.  in a message to his adoring fans  one of the all-time greatest athletes said he just wanted to be celebrated for something so simple.  “i just want to be remembered as a good person and a kid that followed their dreams and achieved more than what i’ve ever dreamed ” the spanish great modestly said after playing in his final match.   despite nadal and spain having just been shockingly ousted from the davis cup by the netherlands  the 38-year-old appeared at peace with his decision to walk away from a trophy-laden career while listening to his peers praise him in a tribute video.  “it was such a privilege to play with you but especially against you ” roger federer said. “congratulations on the most incredible career.”  novak djokovic added  “your tenacity  your fighting spirit  the energy that you brought  the power  is something that will be studied and something that will be transferred to many  many generations that are coming up.  “i’ve been very honored and thrilled to be called your rival.”  serena williams admitted  “you inspired me to have so many wins - to keep going - to fight - to get better - to improve - to basically play like you.”  the accolades could have continued for hours.  as he walked off the court  the tennis great blew kisses to the crowd and hugged his spanish teammates before waving goodbye.  full circle moment nadal’s singular career began in 2001  when he turned professional at the age of just 14.  it wasn’t until april 2002  when nadal was two months shy of his 16th birthday  that he recorded the first atp tour win of his career  which fittingly came on his home island of mallorca.  nadal then propelled himself from world no. 199 to no. 49 in 2003  winning challenger titles and matches at masters 1000 events  as well as recording his first two wins over top 10 opponents – including his current coach  carlos moyá.  the following year would be nadal’s breakthrough on tour and cement his place as a spanish hero.  spain's rafael nadal celebrates winning against france's corentin moutet in three sets  6-3  6-1  6-4  during their second round match at the french open tennis tournament in roland garros stadium in paris  france  wednesday  may 25  2022.

pokrom open and then  at just 18 years of age  beat world no. 2 andy roddick in the final of the davis cup on home soil to help spain win the title for only the second time in history.  it is fitting that nadal bade farewell to tennis on the stage that helped make him in spain.  that year  2003  there was also the small matter of a first meeting with federer  a straight sets win for nadal at the miami open that surely nobody predicted would be the beginning of arguably tennis’ greatest rivalry.  “all that buzz i’d been hearing about you — about this amazing young player from mallorca  a generational talent  probably going to win a major someday — it wasn’t just hype ” federer wrote of that match in his farewell message to nadal.  but 2004 was the year nadal truly shot to stardom and became a household name.  he won 24 straight matches during the clay court season  breaking andre agassi’s open era record for most consecutive victories by a teenager  culminating in his first french open title in his tournament debut.  he may not quite have been the king of clay just yet  but his game on the red stuff was already looking princely.  nadal and spain's carlos alcaraz react while

titles  before he was stunned by robin söderling in the fourth round in 2009 for his first ever defeat at roland garros.  that loss would be the first of just three that nadal suffered at the french open  though he had to retire injured ahead of his third-round match in 2016  giving him a 112-3 record on the parisian clay  a win rate of 97.39%.  “on clay  it felt like i was stepping into your backyard  and you made me work harder than i ever thought i could just to hold my ground ” federer wrote.  “you made me reimagine my game – even going so far as to change the size of my racquet head

australian opens  two wimbledon titles and four us opens for a total of 22 grand slams  second all-time behind only djokovic.  “i’ve been able to compete against him a couple of times  get wins over him which  again  you tell the little kid that’s watching him on tv winning 14 roland garros in a row  it’s pretty special ” world no. 9 alex de minaur told cnn sport.  “all those experiences of sharing the court with him is something i’ll take with me for a very long time and i’ll pass it on to generations to come.”  though grass was considered nadal’s weakest of the three grand slam surfaces  it was on wimbledon’s centre court that he enjoyed arguably his most iconic moment.  in the fading late-evening summer light  nadal finally toppled federer in 2008 and ended the swiss’

month earlier.  in practical darkness on centre court  nadal eventually won 9-7 in the fifth set. it is considered by many to be the greatest tennis match of all time.  “i didn’t watch a lot of tennis growing up but even i was watching rafa ” atp finals runner-up taylor fritz told cnn sport recently.  “i remember the wimbledon final with him and fed and it’s insane that i was a little kid – not

andrew brownbill/ap he also won olympic doubles gold in 2016 and amassed a total of 92 atp titles.  nadal developed a reputation as one of the most tenacious players tennis has seen  chasing down every ball with fierce determination  even those that many other players would have given up as lost causes.  but the question is frequently asked as to whether nadal’s aggressive style of play that made him so successful has in some way contributed to his injury problems.  injuries with the number of injuries nadal has suffered over the course of his career  it’s easy to ask: ‘what if?’  what if he hadn’t missed 11 grand slams due to various ailments? what if his body hadn’t failed him numerous times throughout his career?  how many grand slams would nadal have now? how many more records would he have broken?  but nadal never let the injuries define his career; though  of course  they played a big part. instead  his career has largely been defined by his response to them: his tenacity  his will to win  and his unrelenting desire to come back time and again - and return to the top.  in the end  however  it proved to be one injury too many for his 38-year-old body to recover from – though his mind was evidently still as willing as ever  with nadal often expressing his desire to return again next year.  but the injuries just mean the numbers and records nadal has accumulated over his career are all the more remarkable.,Sports,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/19/sport/rafael-nadal-farewell-to-the-king-of-clay-spt-intl/index.html

27,Justin Trudeau visits Trump at Mar-a-Lago,prime minister justin trudeau arrived at mar-a-lago for an unannounced dinner with donald trump after the president-elect threatened canada with a hefty tariff  according to two people familiar with the meeting granted anonymity to discuss the plans.  he is the first g7 leader to visit the resort since the u.s. election. trudeau is accompanied by public safety minister dominic leblanc who is in charge of border security.   trudeau headed to florida after an unrelated press conference in the prince edward island province  in which he touted his relationship with trump. trudeau said he “looks forward” to “lots of great conversations” with him.   “ultimately  it is through lots of constructive  real conversations with president trump that i’m going to have that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all canadians ” he said friday  although he did not indicate a meeting was imminent.  dining alongside trudeau  trump and leblanc at a table in mar-a-lago were: katie telford  trudeau’s chief of staff; sen.-elect dave mccormick and his wife  former deputy national security adviser dina powell; gov. doug burgum  trump’s nominee to be interior secretary  and his wife; howard lutnick  trump’s nominee to be commerce secretary  and his wife; and incoming national security adviser mike waltz and his wife  said one of the people familiar with the meeting.  the president-elect got all of canada’s attention on monday when he announced on truth social that his day 1 to-do list included slapping 25 percent tariffs on canada. trump conditioned the tariffs on canada securing its border with the united states.  “when he makes statements like that  he plans on carrying them out ” trudeau said friday morning.  “he would be actually not just harming canadians who work so well with the united states ” the prime minister continued. “he [would] actually be raising prices for american citizens as well  and hurting american industry and businesses.”    it’s a message that trudeau’s top ministers spent the past year sharing with anyone south of the border who’d listen.  trudeau has a complicated relationship with the president-elect.  during trump’s first term  the prime minister and his team successfully renegotiated nafta and maintained something of a working relationship with the white house. but trump has also called trudeau “two-faced” and a “far-left lunatic.”  in the hours after trump’s truth social message posted on monday  the prime minister managed to get the incoming president on the horn — a point his ministers kept coming back to this week in the panic that the tariff threat created.  deputy prime minister chrystia freeland insisted that the liberals could be trusted to deal with trump since they’d done it before.  on wednesday  she championed trudeau’s record.  “he was an effective partner for barack obama. he was an effective partner for president trump. he was an effective partner for president biden  who is still president ” she said. “i have every confidence that he will be absolutely effective in dealing with president-elect trump.”,Politics,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/29/justin-trudeau-visits-trump-at-mar-a-lago-00192038
28,Zelenskyy’s diplomatic play for Trump ,u.s. president-elect donald trump’s nomination of keith kellogg  a former national security adviser and decorated retired u.s. general  to be his special envoy to ukraine and russia has reassured a nervous kyiv up to a point.  ukrainian officials are familiar with kellogg  a peace-through-strength advocate who’s argued publicly that any deal to end the nearly three-year-long war of attrition would have to include solid security guarantees for ukraine to ensure there’s lasting peace and to preclude another russian invasion. kellogg is no supporter of just throwing in the towel and letting russia’s vladimir putin get everything he wants.  “we tell the ukrainians  ‘you’ve got to come to the table  and if you don’t come to the table  support from the united states will dry up’  kellogg told reuters in june. and you tell putin  ‘he’s got to come to the table and if you don’t come to the table  then we’ll give ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field’ ” he added.  advertisement  advertisement and unlike others in trump’s maga circle  kellogg welcomed president joe biden’s decision to approve ukraine’s use of u.s.-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside russia  saying it has given trump “more leverage” and adding that “it gives president trump more ability to pivot from that.”  contrast that with the howls of protest over the missile approval from donald trump jr.  mike waltz  the president-elect’s choice to be national security adviser  and richard grenell  who was acting director of national intelligence during trump's first term. “no one anticipated that joe biden would escalate the war in ukraine during the transition period. this is as if he is launching a whole new war ” grenell posted on x. trump’s son accused biden of trying to spark world war iii “before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives.”  in short  kellogg is someone ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy and his circle can work with  and ukraine’s leader already is nimbly adapting to the changed politics in washington — and to shifting political dynamics in europe — by displaying a willingness to come to the table. that’s something his american advisers have urged him to do  leaving it to putin to be mr. nyet  risking trump’s wrath.    that is exactly what zelenskyy was doing on friday in an interview with britain’s sky news. it was a master class in smart diplomatic maneuvering  what with the teasing suggestion of how to end the “hot phase of the war” with ukraine being admitted into nato but with the alliance’s umbrella only applying to the 80 percent of the country still controlled by kyiv. that would leave ukraine free later to resolve diplomatically what happens to the occupied part of the country  he suggested.  under this formula  russia would retain de facto control of the donbas and crimea but without kyiv recognizing their annexation or officially ceding territory — which would require a change in ukraine’s constitution  a move that no doubt would enrage front-line soldiers and a large number of ukrainians. one of his american advisers recently told politico that he doubted zelenskyy could survive politically if he wrote off nearly a quarter of the country.   the sky news interview is the farthest zelenskyy has gone in suggesting kyiv might be ready to give up any territory  temporarily or otherwise. in an interview with le monde in the summer  he did hazard that the occupied territories could join russia if they voted to do so in a referendum conducted freely and fairly. but for that to happen  the areas would have to be back in ukrainian hands for such a vote to take place  he added.  advertisement  advertisement  whether zelenskyy’s latest idea might fly is another matter entirely.  trump is even less likely to endorse nato membership for ukraine than a reluctant biden has been. there would be legal issues on how the alliance’s collective defense pledge wouldn’t apply to occupied parts of ukraine. and putin and his top aides have made it clear time after time that they’ll never agree to ukraine joining nato. just the suggestion is a red flag to a raging bull.  arguably  though  that wasn’t really the point of what zelenskyy was doing on friday. the exercise seemed more intended to show a readiness to consider various options  with the ukrainian leader making clear he wants to work one-to-one with trump. “i want to share with him ideas and i want to hear from him ” zelenskyy said.  above all  kyiv knows that it will have to recalibrate and take care not to get on trump’s bad side  hence zelenskyy’s emphasis on the importance of exploring diplomatic solutions  says former ukrainian foreign minister dmytro kuleba. “listen to his recent interviews in which he says  ‘we have to look for diplomatic solutions ’ ‘we have to return crimea diplomatically ’ ‘we are not strong enough to restore our 1991 borders.’ these are all messages to trump ” kuleba told politico.  the former minister predicts trump will start moving rapidly to try to stop the war  but warns that “neither zelenskyy nor putin are interested in a quick solution because they both believe that will be achieved at their expense.”  kuleba added: “putin firmly believes he's close to getting it all. so why should he agree to anything? the second problem is that if you listen carefully to putin  he says he’s ready for a cease-fire  but not one that will be used to arm ukraine. his demands will be not only territorial concessions and no nato membership  but also basically no ukrainian army. and that will undermine the whole idea of security guarantees.”  the trick for zelenskyy in his dealings with trump is to make sure it is putin who gets the blame for any failed peace initiative.,Politics,https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-diplomatic-play-donald-trump/
29,UK MPs back assisted dying in historic vote,london — mps have voted by 330 to 275 in favor of a bill to legalize assisted dying in england and wales for the first time.  mps backed the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill  introduced by backbench labour mp kim leadbeater  at second reading  meaning it will now continue through parliament for further scrutiny.  the decision followed a packed five-hour debate in the house of commons  where mps made their choice in a free vote  meaning they did not have to vote on party lines.  advertisement  advertisement  prime minister keir starmer  who refused to comment on his position in the build-up the vote  backed the change in the law  as did chancellor rachel reeves and former conservative pm rishi sunak.  introducing the bill  leadbeater urged her colleagues to reflect on “the heartbreaking reality and human suffering which far too many people are experiencing as a result of the status quo.”  she argued the legislation would give dying people choice  autonomy and dignity at the end of their lives.  danny kruger  a conservative mp and one of the most prominent critics of the bill  said mps should not opt for “a vote for despair but the start of a proper debate about dying well in which we do better than a state suicide service.”  start of a proper debate at present  laws throughout the u.k. prevent people from receiving medical help to die.  under the terms of leadbeater’s plan  the right to die would apply to adults who have expressed a clear  settled and informed wish  free from coercion or pressure.  advertisement  advertisement   they must be expected to die within six months  according to two independent doctors  and have the request signed off by a high court judge.   the bill has been the focus of fierce and passionate disagreement at westminster and throughout the country over the past six weeks  with keir starmer’s cabinet split on the issue.   health secretary wes streeting and justice secretary shabana mahmood are among those who opposed the move  while home secretary yvette cooper and work and pensions secretary liz kendall supported the bill.  strong support among voters the bill is now due to pass to committee stage to be examined in detail.   there is strong  bipartisan support for assisted dying for the terminally ill  according to polls carried out by yougov.  a study by the same firm last week showed that 73 percent of britons think assisted dying should be legal. however  19 percent said that while they support assisted dying in principle  they oppose it in practice because they don’t believe adequate laws can be created to regulate it.  reacting to the result  leadbeater told the bbc she felt overwhelmed but added that the debate had shown parliament in its best light and the legislative process to follow would be very thorough.  one mp granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters said some of the bill's opponents were seen leaving the chamber in tears.,Politics,https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-mps-back-assisted-dying-law-at-first-hurdle-in-historic-vote/
30,Florida Has a Weird Political Culture. It’s About to Take Over the White House.,lorida is america’s punchline  a state that exports as many memes as it does oranges. it’s prone to hurricanes and presidential hopefuls — at least six in the last 50 years — and now will be donald trump’s power center and the ideological wellspring for his administration.  there’s his chief of staff susie wiles  pam bondi as trump’s attorney general pick  sen. marco rubio for secretary of state  and rep. mike waltz for national security adviser. no other state will have that level of concentrated influence in the next administration. with florida personalities playing such a central role  it’s important to understand just what constitutes florida political culture.  00:01  03:36 read more    so what is that very florida political sensibility? it’s a geographically enormous state with more than 825 miles of beaches  many of which are slowly  inch by inch  returning to the ocean thanks to climate change  a concept that dare not speak its name in government halls. it was the site of two of the deadliest mass shootings in the nation’s history and lawmakers still try to loosen gun laws. it’s america’s adult playground — but also  by law  requires strippers to be at least 21 to work.   if anything  florida is a place of contradictions. it’s economically lax and also morally overbearing  freewheeling and uptight. it’s home to two cities — miami and orlando — that  according to the census bureau  have some of the highest concentrations in the u.s. of gay-coupled households. but at the same time  the state restricts how teachers  even up to high school  can teach lgbtq+ issues.  the state legislature is no different. florida prides itself on being a place where you can live your life without fear of government intrusion; it’s even gov. ron desantis’ slogan — “the free state of florida.” but state lawmakers in the past few years have passed laws restricting abortion  making it illegal to release balloons at gender reveal parties and polices what books kids can read. the state even blocked kids 14 and under from opening social media accounts even if their parents approve of it.  at the same time  desantis  in the run up to his presidential bid  persuaded lawmakers to pass laws allowing him to run for the white house but not resign as governor and block the media and others from accessing his publicly funded travel.  surprisingly  florida was one of the only states where  in the wake of a tragic mass shooting at a high school  the republican-controlled legislature and gop governor  rick scott  approved gun restrictions. they implemented red flag laws for confiscating guns from dangerous people and raised to 21 the legal age to buy a rifle. but the state reverted to conservative form last year  however  when desantis and state lawmakers made it legal to carry a firearm in public without a permit.    florida was a pioneer in open records laws (“government in the sunshine” is the catchy slogan)  but recently its officials have been working steadily to create exemptions that would conceal what public officials are doing.  it’s no surprise florida is full of contradictions considering its size and diversity. tallahassee  the state’s capital  is just 20 miles from the georgia border  where spanish moss hangs from trees and lawmakers and lobbyists greet each other with “sir” and “ma’am.” five hundred miles away in south florida  enclaves around miami operate more in spanish than english.  a woman holding a sign in spanish that translates to liberty for cuba  cruises the streets. florida has been defined by its migrants and its immigrants — basically everyone is from somewhere else  be it from some other state or some other country. | wilfredo lee/ap  north florida  however  is a far cry from miami  the gateway to latin america and a majority-minority city that is intimately intertwined with the caribbean  central and south america. one of miami’s lawmakers  rep. mario diaz-balart  is the nephew of fidel castro’s first wife. several men who were busted by the fbi last year for plotting to assassinate haiti’s president called miami home.  florida is still a major farming state — it has the 15th-most farms of all 50 states — and the state’s agriculture commissioner is one of only three cabinet positions. this makes it highly coveted. the current commissioner is wilton simpson  the former senate president and a multimillionaire industrial egg farmer who won his seat after beating several opponents  including a worm farmer.   most read biden-white-house-holidays-66668.jpg the hunter biden pardon gives donald trump powerful new political cover newsom becomes the most prominent dem to break with biden over son’s pardon trump will overplay his hand. here’s how to be ready. joe biden’s parting insult ‘it’s a sad statement about where we are’: a pardon expert explains biden’s decision to pardon his son  as much as any other state  florida has been defined by its migrants and its immigrants — basically everyone is from somewhere else  be it from some other state or some other country. it’s the engine of the state’s growth and its economy (new housing is built by immigrants for the benefit of retirees and move-ins from other states;

rubio is a traditional hawk with a from-the-cradle hatred of communism but a desire to negotiate a quick end to the ukraine war; bondi wants to go after “bad prosecutors” much like desantis did with two state attorneys. they have the potential to being much more than florida vibes to the country and could reshape the country in the image of the sunshine state.,Politics,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/28/trump-cabinet-florida-influence-00191930

to federal private school tax credit legislation endorsed by president-elect donald trump that has a path to approval in a republican-controlled congress.    unions hope they can copy a playbook that marshaled voters on nov. 5 to reject a measure that would have enshrined a constitutional right to school choice in colorado  deny a bid to authorize public funding for private education in kentucky

9 in 10 voters backed trump — while 66 percent opposed the private school measure.  “what’s struck me is how much the choice community has really minimized this ” said frederick hess  education

regardless of their income — which has resulted in nearly one in 20 students participating.  but there’s still room for growth — and texas is poised to be the biggest battleground.  greg abbott speaks on stage. texas gov. greg abbott says he now has 79 votes in the state house to support a voucher bill  three beyond what’s required to approve legislation in that chamber. | andrew harnik/getty images  the american federation for children  a school choice organization founded by former education secretary betsy devos that spends heavily in state legislative races  said it spent more than $8 million in the texas primary and general elections to cement a voucher-friendly state house majority to support what could eventually become the nation’s largest statewide school choice program.    abbott  the texas governor  says he now has 79 votes in the state house to support a voucher bill  three beyond what’s required to approve legislation in that chamber.  “i made sure that we would elect republicans to the texas house of representatives in sufficient numbers to be able to pass a school choice plan just like the texas senate has passed many times ” abbott declared during a post-election news conference at a christian private school where he boasted a “tidal wave of support” for his endorsed house candidates.  texas lt. gov. dan patrick  who serves as president of the texas senate  called on abbott to prioritize school choice legislation as an emergency item next year  a move that would allow lawmakers to approve such a bill within the first 60 days of the state’s forthcoming legislative session.  unions are vowing to resist the texas proposal.  “we’ll be using every tool that we have available to us ” including legal challenges  to resist the texas effort  pringle told reporters earlier this month. “we fought this battle in texas before  and we will continue to fight it.  tennessee’s governor and republican lawmakers will revisit a statewide voucher proposal that failed earlier this year.  this time  bicameral bills to authorize up to 20 000 public-funded private school tuition scholarships include potential sweeteners to coax potential holdouts  such as $2 000 public school teacher bonuses and tax tweaks to support public school construction projects.  the nea also expects north dakota lawmakers to debate their own law  more than one year after republican gov. doug burgum  who has since been nominated by trump to be interior secretary  vetoed a private school tuition subsidy bill.  there’s little evidence that the referendum defeats are causing republicans to reconsider their support for expanding voucher programs.   “it’s important not to over interpret the referendum results ” said michael petrilli  president of the conservative thomas b. fordham institute. “the teacher unions are a very effective political machine and it’s not hard when you’re voting over these things in direct democracy to demagogue the issue.”  but petrilli  a school choice proponent who opposes subsidizing wealthy households through broad voucher programs  said lawmakers could be overestimating their political support when such initiatives don’t have much to offer suburban or rural-dwelling households that might be happy with their local schools or have no other option.  “the kiss of death in these debates is to play into the mindset that this is somehow about hurting public education ” he said. “there could be a real backlash here … you’re going to piss a lot of people off by writing big checks to wealthy families.”  and despite anti-voucher energy at the polls  conservative lawmakers still have an advantage in states like north carolina where voters can’t channel their views through ballot box referendums.  “folks go and they vote for their legislators  and the legislators enact policies ” moore said of north carolina’s system. “and i would say educational access was a key component of a lot of campaigns  and with that being a key message  republicans maintained very comfortable majorities.,Politics,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/27/republican-school-voucher-program-expansion-voters-00191598
34,Trump’s effect on the Middle East,united states president joe biden and his aides deserve much of the credit for brokering the cease-fire between israel and hezbollah  which came into effect overnight tuesday  after the president’s special envoy amos hochstein and u.s. secretary of state antony blinken have been tirelessly coaxing and cajoling lebanon and israel for months.  french president emmanuel macron took a bow as well  saying the cease-fire was “the culmination of efforts undertaken for many months with the israeli and lebanese authorities  in close collaboration with the united states.”  advertisement  advertisement   but a crucial factor in the sudden agreement is arguably u.s. president-elect donald trump.  for good or ill  depending on your viewpoint  trump is already shaping the calculations of combatants in the middle east and in europe  as they seek to guess what he’ll want once back in the white house  jockeying to find favor beforehand.  it can be dubbed the trump effect — and his nominees for the top jobs in his administration haven’t been shy of citing its impact on bringing forth the cease-fire. “everyone is coming to the table because of president trump ” florida lawmaker mike waltz  trump’s pick for national security adviser  declared on social media site x tuesday  shortly before the israeli cabinet signed off on the truce.  “his resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. i’m glad to see concrete steps towards de-escalation in the middle east ” waltz added. and the boast doesn’t seem to be just bravado either. trump’s electoral win appears to have concentrated minds enough to get the cease-fire over the line.  for one  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu didn’t need to guess what trump wanted for lebanon. the president-elect and his allies assiduously courted arab-americans on the campaign trail — especially in the key swing state of michigan  where trump pushed the line that he could arrange peace and “stop the wars.”  lebanese-american businessman massad boulos  the father-in-law of trump’s daughter tiffany  was also a key emissary  exploiting the disillusionment of arab-americans furious with the current administration’s policies on gaza and the war in lebanon. if trump wins the election  he’ll “act immediately to end the war in lebanon and won’t wait until his inauguration in january ” he told the saudi-funded al-arabiya new outlet.  advertisement  advertisement   and by all accounts  trump didn’t hold back.  as politico reported days after the u.s. election  it was clear that despite the president-elect’s hawkish picks to head his national security and foreign policy teams  netanyahu wouldn’t be given free rein in his ambition to recast the middle east.  “trump expects a cease-fire on lebanon soon — even before he’s inaugurated ” an israeli official familiar with the matter  granted anonymity to speak candidly  had said.  that wish was conveyed to israeli strategic affairs minister ron dermer when he met trump at his mar-a-lago resort on nov. 11 — tellingly  the day before sitting down with blinken to discuss cease-fire options.   under the agreement  the israeli military will slowly withdraw forces from southern lebanon. | afp via getty images the question now is whether the truce can hold. there’s a lot that can go awry — particularly since hezbollah didn’t directly participate in the talks  leaving it to a political ally  the speaker of the parliament of lebanon nabih berri  to act on its behalf.  under the agreement  the israeli military will slowly withdraw forces from southern lebanon  while hezbollah moves north of the litani river  as it was meant to do under the u.n. resolution that brought the 2006 war to an end. lebanon will reinforce the area south of the river  deploying an additional 10 000 troops throughout the transition period of 60 days.  advertisement advertisement  reportedly  hezbollah has also agreed to not smuggle weapons from syria into lebanon to make up for what israel has destroyed in its punishing airstrikes the past few weeks. the cease-fire monitoring will then be led by the u.s. military  with support from the french.  biden  for his part  has stated he hopes this will turn into a permanent cessation of hostilities  but according to netanyahu  its durability will depend on what happens in lebanon. “with the full understanding of the united states  we are preserving full military freedom of action — if hezbollah breaks the agreement and seeks to arm itself  we will attack ” he said in a televized address on tuesday.  in such a case  it is unclear whether israel would wait for u.s. and french arbiters to determine if there had been a violation and whether it merited action. according to lebanese officials who briefed politico on background  israel’s right to strike back for any violations crucially isn’t part of the formal agreement. the lebanese weren’t prepared to include israel’s freedom of action in the cease-fire deal on grounds it would breach lebanese sovereignty.  the next day or so could thus prove rather risky  with lebanese shiites rushing to get back to their villages in the south — urged by berri to do so despite official instructions from the israeli and lebanese armies to wait until israeli troops withdraw gradually. on wednesday  for example  israeli soldiers shot at returnees they suspected of being hezbollah members in the southern lebanese village meiss al-jabal  after israel’s defense minister ordered “forceful action” to keep the militia group’s members from returning.  and even if the cease-fire weathers the next few days  there are other major risks.  unsurprisingly  netanyahu faced fierce opposition in getting the truce approved by his cabinet  with the ultranationalists dubbing the deal “a grave mistake” that’s squandering an “historic opportunity” to eliminate hezbollah. this means the israeli leader will be facing the likely wrath of the far-right politicians in his government if he hesitates to lash out for even minor infringements by hezbollah  which could  in turn  trigger a quick response and lead to escalation by both sides. in a statement by hezbollah’s operations center  the group made no direct mention of the deal but said its fighters would monitor the withdrawal of israeli troops “with their hands on the trigger.”  advertisement  advertisement  according to polls  israeli public opinion regarding the cease-fire is also divided down the middle.  in essence  the cease-fire falls far short of what netanyahu had outlined as his goal for military action in lebanon: crushing hezbollah in much the same way he’s been crushing hamas in gaza. still  the israeli leader argued he wasn’t letting the militant shiite group off the hook  saying “hezbollah is no longer the same. it has gone back decades.” but the deal doesn’t involve disarming hezbollah  which has the possibility to militarily regroup and live to fight another day with the thousands of long-range and short-range missiles  drones and rockets it still likely has.  rather  the truce will see only the partial implementation of 2006 u.n. resolution 1701 — meaning no hezbollah presence south of the litani  no units  no rockets and no tunnels  yet without the requirement for all lebanese groups  including hezbollah  to disarm.  so why should it be different this time? the lebanese armed forces (laf) is no match for the lebanese shiite militia  even in its now degraded state  and it has failed to compel hezbollah to withdraw to the litani before. in fact  more shiites have entered laf ranks since 2006  raising the question of divided loyalties.  more immediately  much depends on how hezbollah’s bosses in tehran proceed. there seems little appetite in the iranian capital to enrage trump — the country is hardly in shape to fight a proxy war against israel while trump turns the screws on iran economically. thus  iran has been pushing the door ajar for talks with washington about resuming negotiations over its nuclear program.  the cease-fire has tehran’s support too — at least for now. on wednesday  it welcomed what it called the end of israel’s “aggression” in lebanon  and ali larijani  an adviser to iran’s supreme leader ali khamenei  said the country backed a cease-fire in videos posted earlier this week. however  there was also a sting in the tail  as he warned hezbollah hadn’t yet utilized “its most important equipment” and that if it did in the future  “the situation could change entirely.”  here  larijani was speaking in the context of how iran might respond to israel’s oct. 26 airstrikes on iranian military targets — retaliation for a previous iranian missile barrage on israel. “military officials are exploring various options for such a response ” he added.  how iran responds will no doubt determine whether the cease-fire is short-lived.,Politics,https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-effect-middle-east-cease-fire-israel-hezbollah/
35,Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire quiets northern front — but not Gaza,jerusalem — for many across the middle east  the israel-hezbollah ceasefire came as a relief: the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago.  but for palestinians in gaza and families of hostages held in the territory  the news appeared only to inaugurate a newer  grimmer period of the conflict there. for them  it marked yet another missed opportunity to end fighting that has stretched on for nearly 14 months.   palestinians had hoped that any ceasefire deal with hezbollah would include a truce in gaza as well. the families of people kidnapped when hamas-led militants stormed southern israel in october 2023  meanwhile  wanted part of the agreement to include returning their loved ones. instead  the ceasefire was confined only to the fighting in lebanon.   “we feel this is a missed opportunity to tie in the hostages in this agreement that was signed today ” said ruby chen  whose son  itay chen  was taken hostage from an israeli military base and has been declared dead.  as much as they were intertwined  the two wars have been very different. in lebanon  israel said its aim was to drive hezbollah back from the countries’ shared border and end the militant group’s barrages into northern israel. the ceasefire that took effect wednesday is intended to do that.  protesters block an intersection in jerusalem on nov. 27  2024  during a demonstration by relatives of hostages held by hamas in the gaza strip and their supporters to call for a hostage release deal.   protesters block an intersection in jerusalem on nov. 27  2024  during a demonstration by relatives of hostages held by hamas in the gaza strip and their supporters to call for a hostage release deal. | maya alleruzzo/ap  in gaza  israel’s goals are more sweeping. prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been resolute in insisting that hamas must be completely destroyed and israel must retain lasting control over parts of the territory. months of talks have failed to get netanyahu to back down from those demands — or to convince hamas to release hostages under those terms.   for palestinians in gaza  that means continuing misery under an israeli campaign that has demolished much of the territory and driven almost the entire population from their homes. hundreds of thousands are going hungry while living in squalid tent cities as the second winter of the war brings cold rains and flooding.  ”they agree to a ceasefire in one place and not in the other? have mercy on the children  the elderly and the women ” said ahlam abu shalabi  living in tent in central gaza. “now it is winter  and all the people are drowning.”  palestinians feel resigned to continued war: the war between israel and hamas began on oct. 7  2023  when militants attacked israel from gaza  killing around 1 200 people and taking some 250 hostage. israel’s retaliatory offensive has rained devastation on the palestinian territory  killing over 44 000 people  according to local health officials. the officials  who do not distinguish between civilians and fighters in their count  say over half of the dead are women and children.  hezbollah began firing into israel a day after hamas’ attack in solidarity with the palestinian militant group. the two sides have exchanged near-daily barrages since. moving thousands of troops to its northern border  israel ramped up bombardment of southern lebanon and launched a ground invasion there two months ago  killing many of hezbollah’s leaders.  palestinians now fear israel’s military can return its full focus to gaza — a point that netanyahu made as he announced the ceasefire in lebanon on tuesday.  “the pressure will be more on gaza ” said mamdouh younis  a displaced man in a central gaza tent camp. netanyahu  he said  can now exploit the fact that “gaza has become alone  far from all the arenas that were supporting it  especially the lebanon front.”  israeli troops are already engaged in fierce fighting in gaza’s north  where a two-month offensive has cut off most aid and caused experts to warn a famine may be underway. strikes all over the territory regularly kill dozens.  in signing onto the ceasefire deal  hezbollah reversed its long-held position that it wouldn’t stop its barrages across the border unless israel ends the war in gaza.

have a psychological impact  as it will further entrench the understanding that palestinians in gaza are alone in resisting against their occupiers ” said tariq kenney shawa  a u.s. policy fellow at al-shabaka  a palestinian think tank.  hamas may dig its heels in: it also leaves hamas — its capabilities already severely damaged by israel’s offensive — to fight alone. hamas official osama hamdan appeared to accept hezbollah’s new position in an interview monday.  “any announcement of a ceasefire is welcome. hezbollah has stood by our people and made significant sacrifices ” hamdan told the lebanese broadcaster al-mayadeen  which is seen as politically allied with hezbollah.  khalil sayegh  a palestinian analyst  said the ceasefire could make hamas even less popular in gaza  by proving the failure of its gambit that its attack on israel would rally other militant groups to the fight.  “it’s a moment where we can see the hamas messaging become weaker and weaker  as they struggle to justify their strategy to the public ” said sayegh.  u.s. secretary of state antony blinken said tuesday that the israel-hezbollah ceasefire could help force hamas to the negotiating table because it would show the group that the “cavalry is not on the way.”  but hamas experts predicted that it would only dig in both on the battlefield and in talks. hamas has insisted it will only release all the hostages in return for a full israeli withdrawal from gaza.  “i expect hamas will continue using guerrilla warfare to confront israeli forces in gaza as long as they remain ” said shawa.  hostage families lose hope: dozens of israelis thronged a major highway in tel aviv on tuesday night  protesting for the return of the hostages as the country waited to hear if a ceasefire in lebanon had been agreed.  around 100 people taken hostage are still held in gaza  at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. most of the other hostages seized by hamas were released during a ceasefire last year.   ricardo grichener  the uncle of 23-year-old hostage omer wenkert  said the ceasefire with hezbollah showed how the israeli government was openly disregarding the hostages.  even though israel has inflicted greater damage on hamas in gaza than on hezbollah in lebanon  he said “the decision to postpone a deal in gaza and release the hostages is not based on the same military success criteria.”  the most recent effort to wind down the war stalled in october. u.s. president joe biden said tuesday he would begin a renewed push  but his administration is now in its waning days after the reelection of former president donald trump.  “this ceasefire doesn’t concern our hostages. i believe that netanyahu forgot about them  and he just wants to keep fighting in gaza ” said ifat kalderon  clutching a photo of her cousin  ofer kalderon  who is a hostage and a father to four.  “ofer yesterday had his 54th birthday. his second birthday in gaza ” she said. “it’s unbelievable that he’s still there.”,Politics,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/28/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-quiets-one-front-but-gaza-sees-no-end-to-war-00192017
36,Ruble tumbles as Russia’s war economy comes under increasing strain,the ruble tumbled on wednesday to its lowest level in over two years  as a mix of low oil prices  new sanctions against russian businesses and burgeoning government spending on its war effort put ever-greater strain on the russian economy.  the central bank reacted by suspending currency purchases for the rest of this year. that will restrict the supply of rubles and should support the exchange rate accordingly. it took a similar step last year  after the mutiny of mercenary leader yevgeny prigozhin triggered another crisis of confidence.  as such  the measure will help to keep a lid on a growing inflation problem  which has forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate to 21 percent. official data show inflation running at 8.5 percent  but private surveys such as those by market research firm romir suggest that the actual rate is much higher.  advertisement  advertisement  the ruble has been under steady pressure all summer  as the price of oil — russia’s most important export  despite western sanctions — has fallen due to weak chinese and european demand and rapidly growing supply from the u.s.  brazil and guyana. brent crude prices have fallen nearly 4 percent this week alone on relief at the ceasefire agreed to by israel and hezbollah.  that pressure intensified after the u.s. imposed a new round of sanctions on gazprombank  which until then had been allowed to process payments for what remains of russia’s gas export business to europe. the new package also targeted 50 internationally connected russian banks  more than 40 russian securities registrars  and 15 russian finance officials.   “the sanctions packages imposed are having their negative effects  felt by russians mainly in the form of high inflation ” said grzegorz drozdz  market analyst at conotoxia.  the ruble fell as far as 114.75 to the u.s. dollar  according to data from investing.com  a level unseen since march 2022  just after russia started its war in ukraine. by late trading in moscow it had recovered to 113.15  a drop of over 7 percent on the day.  angry oligarchs the central bank’s tight monetary policy has drawn increasing criticism from the country’s leading industrialists  such as metals baron oleg deripaska and sergey chemezov  the influential head of defense conglomerate rostech. chemezov’s organization is responsible for making much of the equipment needed to fight the war in ukraine.  “it’s as if the medicine is more harmful than the disease ” severstal chairman alexey mordashov was quoted by rbc as telling a conference in st. petersburg on wednesday.  “we need serious discussions on this topic ” mordashov said. “this is a situation probably without precedent in modern world history  when the central bank rate is 2.5 times higher than inflation  and it still doesn’t slow down.”  the cbr raised interest rates to 21 percent at its last meeting  and governor elvira nabiullina threatened another increase at its next meeting. so far this year the bank has raised its policy rate by 500 basis points  but has been unable to stop the ruble losing nearly a quarter of its value against the dollar,Politics,https://www.politico.eu/article/ruble-value-falls-russia-war-economy-ukraine-oil-prices-sanctions-inflation-interest-rates-oligarchs/
37,Big tech’s AI spending hits new heights,amazon is gearing up to roll out a revamped version of its alexa voice assistant  which is expected to be available this october  right before the us shopping rush.  internally referred to as “remarkable ” the new technology will be powered by anthropic’s claude ai models. sources close to the matter have indicated that this shift occurred due to the underperformance of amazon’s in-house software.  the enhanced alexa will operate using advanced generative ai to handle more complex queries. amazon plans to offer the new alexa as a subscription service  priced between $5 and $10 per month  while the classic version of alexa will remain free. this approach marks a significant change for amazon and suggests that the company aims to turn this voice assistant into a profitable venture after years of limited success in generating revenue through this platform.  amazon’s decision to quickly adopt an external model  claude  indicates a strategic shift. amazon typically prefers to build everything in-house to minimise its dependence on third-party vendors  thereby avoiding external influences on customer behaviour and business strategies  as well as external influences on who controls data. however  it seems that amazon’s traditional strategy does not provide the massive ai capability needed  or perhaps amazon has realised the need for more powerful ai. it is also worth noting that the involved ai developer  openai  is affiliated with major technology companies like apple and microsoft in developing ai technologies.  the launch of the “remarkable” alexa is anticipated during amazon’s annual devices and services event in september  though the company has not confirmed the exact date. this event will also mark the first public appearance of panos panay  the new head of amazon’s devices division  who has taken over from long-time executive david limp.  the updated version of alexa would be a more interactive and intuitive assistant  as the new functionality would stem from its conversational mode. the assistant is envisioned to do more than just recognise patterns in people’s speech; it would be able to hold conversations built on previous interactions. the most likely features include personalised shopping advice  news aggregation  and more advanced home automation. as for whether customers would pay for alexa  this likely depends on the final set of available features. the issue might be particularly pressing for amazon  given that customers already pay for prime membership.  the future for alexa is quite ambitious  but it also bears significant risks. for the new version to be successful  internal performance benchmarks must be met. while estimates for “remarkable” alexa suggest that even a small percentage of current users paying for the premium version could become a substantial income stream for amazon  the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes remains uncertain.  however  amazon’s partnership with anthropic is currently under regulatory review  largely due to an investigation by the uk’s antitrust regulator. the impending upgrade announcement and the regulator’s response could significantly influence the company’s future activities.  amazon’s initiative to adopt an ai solution developed by anthropic marks a significant shift for the company  which previously focused on developing its proprietary technology. at this point  it is possible to view this move as part of the general trend in the industry to turn to partnerships regarding ai development to enhance the competitiveness of products.,AI,https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/big-tech-ai-spending-hits-new-heights/

40,Canadian news companies sue OpenAI,a group of canadian news and media companies filed a lawsuit friday against openai  alleging that the chatgpt maker has infringed their copyrights and unjustly enriched itself at their expense.  the companies behind the lawsuit include the toronto star  the canadian broadcasting corporation  the globe and mail  and others that seek to win monetary damages and ban openai from making further use of their work.  the news companies said that openai has used content scraped from their websites to train the large language models that power chatgpt — content that is “the product of immense time  effort  and cost on behalf of the news media companies and their journalists  editors  and staff.”  the companies wrote in their suit that “rather than seek to obtain the information legally  openai has elected to brazenly misappropriate the news media companies’ valuable intellectual property and convert it for its own uses  including commercial uses  without consent or consideration.”  openai is also facing copyright lawsuits from the new york times  new york daily news  youtube creators  and authors including comedian sarah silverman.   while openai has signed licensing deals with publishers such as the associated press  axel springer  and le monde  the companies behind the new suit said they have “never received from openai any form of consideration  including payment  in exchange for openai’s use of their works.”  an openai spokesperson said in a statement that chatgpt is used by “hundreds of millions of people around the world … to improve their daily lives  inspire creativity  and solve hard problems ” and that its models are “trained on publicly available data  grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.”  strictlyvc san francisco mix and mingle with other investors and founders  and hear insights from top-tier vcs san francisco | december 4 register now “we collaborate closely with news publishers  including in the display  attribution and links to their content in chatgpt search  and offer them easy ways to opt-out should they so desire ” the spokesperson said.  this new lawsuit comes shortly after columbia university’s tow center for digital journalism published a study finding that “no publisher — regardless of degree of affiliation with openai — was spared inaccurate representations of its content in chatgpt.”,AI,https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/canadian-news-companies-sue-openai/
41,Cloned customer voice beats bank security checks,artificial intelligence can now clone human voices so well they that they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  but how would it fare against the voice recognition tech that is supposed to protect people's bank accounts?  as part of the bbc's scam safe week  i have been investigating the power of voice cloning.  the consumer champion martin lewis is among the celebrities whose voice has been targeted by scammers. and i spoke to the actor james nesbitt  who said he was horrified at how realistic a cloned version of his voice was.  so i thought i would see what mine sounds like.  my voice was cloned by the same expert that did james nesbitt's - his was for an awareness-raising campaign by starling bank. mine was easily generated using an interview i had done on the radio.  while we had fun typing in different phrases for my clone to say back  the serious issue was finding out how convincing it really was.  colleagues in the you and yours office struggled to tell the difference between the two voices.  but rather than seeing if an ai voice could dupe people into believing they were listening to the voice of a real person  i wanted to see how it fared against a piece of tech.  could it get past my bank account's voice id system?     53:00 can you hack into a bank account using ai voice cloning? several banks use a system called voice id or 'my voice is my password' for their phone banking.  the phrase allows the bank to automatically confirm an account holder's identity without the need to remember a security number.  so that was what i asked my cloned voice to say.  armed with a recording of an ai version of me saying my voice is my password i called up my bank  santander.  thanks for calling santander  came the automated response. i can see you're calling from your registered phone number. let's quickly confirm your identity with your voice.  i pressed play.  my voice is my password  said an ai version of me.  after a very brief pause  the bank replied: thank you for using your voice as your password.  then it asked the reason for my call.  i was in. or at least  this ai cloned version of my voice was in.  i then tried the same trick with my other bank  halifax  and it resulted in another successful hack by the ai clone.  i should point out that those initial logins were done in the office  using bbc studio speakers to play my cloned voice down the phone.  so later  a my kitchen table at home on merseyside  i did it again using a basic ipad speaker. and it worked  which suggested there was no need for top-quality sound.  it is also worth noting that i had called from my registered phone number. so a criminal would need to have stolen my phone - and to have kept it unlocked - to get in this way. not straightforward  but very possible with a snatch theft.   'optional security' the sort of information you can get at the stage of phone banking i had reached using an ai voice is potentially very useful to criminals.  recently on you and yours we heard from a woman who was tricked into believing a criminal who had called her was from her bank.  he had won her trust because he knew transaction information about her account.  when i told banks what i had been able to do using an ai version of my voice  santander said: we have not seen any fraud as a result of the use of voice id and are confident that it provides greater levels of security than traditional knowledge-based authentication methods.  it said voice id was one element of our stringent approach to customer security and fraud prevention  with a range of comprehensive checks based on the nature of the customer's request.  it added: we constantly review  test and enhance our systems in response to increasingly sophisticated tactics used by fraudsters.  halifax described voice id as an optional security measure.  it added: we are confident that it offers a higher level of security compared to traditional knowledge-based authentication methods  and that our layered approach to security and fraud prevention provides the right level of protection for customers' accounts  while still making them easy to access when needed.  i also played a recording of me breaking into my own bank to saj huq  a cyber security specialist and member of the uk government's national cyber advisory board.  wow  he said. i say wow  because i'm dismayed that you're able to get into your account using this technology - but i'm also not surprised at the same time  just given the rate of development of technology in this space.  he added being able to use an av voice to get past voice recognition software was a really clear example of just one element of the risks that potentially the proliferation of generative ai presents.,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lg3ded6j9o
42,AI spurs 'revolution' for some visually impaired people,“ai has revolutionised my daily life ” says louise plunkett from norwich.  ms plunkett has a genetic eye condition called stargardt disease  a rare condition that causes progressive vision loss  which she says  “impacts everything i do”.  “i can’t recognise people  even my own husband or my children. when my children were younger  i used to have to teach them how to come to me when i met them at the school playground.”  ms plunkett is comfortable with digital tools - her business advises companies on how to ensure their online content is suitable for the visually impaired community.  she has used services like alexa  google home and siri for years  helping with tasks like setting alarms and weather checks.  now she is finding an assistant called be my ai useful.  the app uses chatgpt to generate and then read out detailed descriptions of pictures.  “i’m quite a stubborn person ” says ms plunkett. “i don’t like asking for help or admitting i need help  so using the ai tool is useful for things when other humans aren’t around.”  she says she might use it to check which is the female toilets  or read the ingredients on food packaging  or read a letter.  advertising  however  she feels that ai can sometimes be hit or miss. “the downside with ai is that sometimes it gives you too many details. you sometimes just want the basic information of what is in front of you  but it will go above and beyond  and offer up mood and emotions.  for example  it might say 'a swirling carpet evoking memories of times gone by'. it feels like it is one step too far.”  be my ai was developed by danish firm be my eyes. its original service put human volunteers in touch with its clients. via mobile phones the volunteers would describe what was in front of the person with vision problems.  however  some of its 600 000 users are switching to their ai tool for help  says jesper hvirring henriksen  chief technology officer.  “we have a woman who was one of our first users 10 years ago  and within the first six months [of releasing be my ai]  she did more than 600 image descriptions.”  he’s also discovering people are using the app in ways they hadn’t imagined. “we’re finding people using it to check pictures that have been sent to them on whatsapp groups ” he says.  “maybe they’re not going to call another human each time to ask them about a picture sent on a whatsapp group  but they use ai.”  by my eyes lady holds up her phone in front of her eyes - the phone is displaying an image of her eyes.by my eyes be my eyes connects volunteers with the visually impaired  as for where it might go in the future  he says live streaming video – with the tech describing buildings and movements around them - might be an area they move into. “this is going to be a gamechanger. it’s like having a little person in your shirt pocket all day telling you what is going on.”  be my eyes  which is free to users  makes money by signing up companies to its paid-for directory service where they can provide information and numbers to the blind and low-vision community.  mr henrikson says ai won’t replace the need for human connection.  “at be my eyes  people are still choosing to call a volunteer too. the blind population in the western world are generally not young when they start to experience vision loss… it’s more skewed towards the elderly population and this [ai] might add a later extra of complexity. humans are faster and potentially more accurate.”,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4lvw6vzkyo
43,Is there something special about the human voice?,artificial intelligence-powered speech synthesisers can now hold eerily realistic spoken conversations  putting on accents  whispering and even cloning the voices of others. so how can we tell them apart from the human voice?  these days it's quite easy to strike up a conversation with ai. ask a question of some chatbots  and they'll even provide an engaging response verbally. you can chat with them across multiple languages and request a reply in a particular dialect or accent.  it is now even possible to use ai-powered speech cloning tools to replicate the voices of real humans. one was recently used to copy the voice of the late british broadcaster sir michael parkinson to produce an eight-part podcast series while natural history broadcaster sir david attenborough was profoundly disturbed to hear his voice has been cloned by ai and used to say things he never uttered.  in some cases the technology is being used in sophisticated scams to trick people into handing over money to criminals.  not all ai-generated voice are used for nefarious means. they are also being built into chatbots powered by large language models so they can hold respond and converse in a far more natural and convincing way. chatgpt's voice function  for example  can now reply using variations of tone and emphasis on certain words in very similar ways that a human would to convey empathy and emotion. it can also pick up non-verbal cues such as sighs and sobs  speak in 50 languages and is able to render accents on the fly. it can even make phone calls on behalf of users to help with tasks. at one demonstration by openai  the system ordered strawberries from a vendor.  these capabilities raise an interesting question: is there anything unique about the human voice to help us distinguish it from robo-speech?  jonathan harrington  a professor of phonetics and digital speech processing at the university of munich  germany  has spent decades studying the intricacies of how humans talk  produce the sounds of words and accents. even he is impressed by the capabilities of ai-powered voice synthesisers.   in the last 50 years  and especially recently  speech generation/synthesis systems have become so good that it is often very difficult to tell an ai-generated and a real voice apart  he says.  but he believes there are still some important cues that can help us to tell if we are talking to a human or an ai.  before we get into that  however  we decided to set up a little challenge to see just how convincing an ai-generated voice could be compared to a human one. to do this we asked new york university stern school of business chief ai architect conor grennan to create pairs of audio clips reading out short segments of text.  one was a passage from lewis carroll's classic tale  alice in wonderland read by grennan and the other was an identical segment generated with an ai speech cloning tool from software company elevenlabs. you can listen to them both below to see if you can tell the difference.    0:34 one of these voices reading out a segment from alice in wonderland was generated using ai  surprisingly  around half of the people we played the clips to couldn't tell which was which by ear. it's worth pointing out that our experiment was far from scientific and the clips weren't being listened to over high-end audio equipment – just typical laptop and smart phone speakers.  steve grobman  who serves as the chief technology officer of cybersecurity company  mcafee  struggled to discern which voice was human and which was ai merely by listening with his ear.  there were definitely things beyond speech  like the inhalation which would have me go more towards human  but the cadence  balance  tonality would push me to ai  he says. for the untrained human ear  many of these things can be difficult to pick up.  humans are very bad at this  says grobman  explaining that deepfake detection software is helping catch things the human ear can miss. but it gets especially challenging when bad actors manipulate real audio with bits of fake audio  he says  pointing to a video of microsoft co-founder bill gates hawking a quantum ai stock trading tool. to the human ear  the audio sounded exactly like the tech billionaire  but running it through a scam classifier  it was flagged as a deepfake.  mcafee recently highlighted how a fabricated advert used mixed deepfake and real audio of singer taylor swift. grobman's tip: always listen to the context of what is being said  things that sound suspicious likely are.   we live in a post-real society where ai generated voice clones can fool even the voice validation systems of credit card companies – pete nicoletti  another cybersecurity expert we spoke to – pete nicoletti  global chief information security officer of check point software  a threat analysis platform – was also stumped by our alice in wonderland challenge.  he says he usually listens for unnatural speech patterns such as irregular pauses and awkward phrasing when playing audio. strange artefacts like distortions and mismatched background noise can also be a give-away. he also listens for limited variations in volume  cadence and tone because voices that are cloned from just a few seconds of audio may not have the full range of a human voice.  we live in a post-real society where ai generated voice clones can fool even the voice validation systems of credit card companies  nicoletti says. turing would be turning over in his grave right now  referring to world war ii british code breaker alan turing  who designed the turing test as a way to identify ai by engaging with it in conversation.  dane sherrets  innovation architect of emerging technologies at hackerone  a community of bug bounty hunters that work to expose security vulnerabilities of some of the biggest companies in the world  was among those able to correctly identify the human voice. the natural inflection and breathing in the clips were the give-away  he says.  listening for the accentuation  or emphasis  words are given in a sentence can be a good trick for spotting computer-generated speech  agrees harrington. this is because humans use accentuation to give a sentence more meaning within the context of a dialogue.  for example  a sentence like 'marianna made the marmalade' typically has most emphasis on the first and last words if read as an individual sentence devoid of context  he says. but if someone asked if marianna bought the marmalade  the emphasis might instead fall on the word made in the answer.  intonation – the change in pitch of the voice across a sentence – can also change the same words from being a statement (marianne made the marmalade)  into a question (marianne made the marmalade?).  estudio santa rita the ability to clone people's voices creates a security risk by potentially fooling voice recognition systems  friends and family (credit: estudio santa rita)estudio santa rita the ability to clone people's voices creates a security risk by potentially fooling voice recognition systems  friends and family (credit: estudio santa rita)  phrasing is also an important factor. the way a sentence is broken up can also alter its meaning. the sentence when danger threatens  children call the police  has a very different meaning from when danger threatens children  call the police  harrington explains.  together these three elements of speech are known as sentence-level prosody. it is one of the ways computer-generated speech has been quite poor and not very human like  says harrington.  but as the technology develops  ai is growing more adept at replicating these aspects of speech too.  if you think about it  this is the worst the technology is ever going to be  says sherrets. even something that is 60% as good is still pretty powerful. it's only going to get cheaper  faster  better from here.   he and many of the people we spoke to are particularly worried about voice cloning. it is a very real threat for businesses  for example. assaf rappaport  chief executive at wiz  a leading cybersecurity company  told an audience at a technology conference in october that someone had created a voice clone of him from one of his recent talks. they then used it to send a deepfake voice message to dozens of employees in an attempt to steal credentials. the scammers were unsuccessful  but the incident was a wakeup call.   in another example  a school principal received death threats after a fake audio clip appeared to show him making deeply offensive remarks. other cases have seen family members scammed out of money in phone calls using voice clones of their loved ones.  sherrets advises developing other ways of authenticating that you really are speaking to the person you think you are.  at home this means deciding on family passwords  he says. at work this means not making a wire transfer just because you got a voice message from the chief executive officer of your company.  you can also ask personal questions  such as their favourite song. but perhaps the best thing to do if you suspect an ai is impersonating someone you know is to say you will call them back. call them on the number you have for them and don't panic.  many of ai-voice systems struggle to speak outside the normal vocal range michael mcnerney is senior vice president of security at cyber risk insurance firm  resilience  which covers attacks like spear fishing where employees are duped into wire transferring money with deepfake audio. he too correctly guessed which voice was ai and which was human in our alice in wonderland challenge.   as he listened to the samples  he found himself asking: is that real breathing or fake breathing? were there any mistakes being made? was it too bright  too perfect? stumbling over words and taking breaths are very human  so if things are too perfect  it can actually be a sign that ai is faking it.  but mcnerney says even here  the technology is sounding more and more human. these are super hard to tell  he says.  ai v the mind  this article is part of ai v the mind  a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge ai  and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. each article will pit a human expert against an ai tool to probe a different aspect of cognitive ability. can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian  or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? we hope to find out.  listening to our two pairs of audio clips  harrington and his colleagues at the university of munich's institute of phonetics also struggled to tell the ai voices apart when listening by ear. they pointed to a number of features that should have helped them identify the human speech.  variations in the rate of speech are often an apparent giveaway of a human voice  but in fact the ai voice seemed to produce this more than the human in our examples.   breath intakes too should also be another tell-tale sign. a few of those we played the clips to identified something off about the breathing in both sets of clips. harrington and his colleagues also said they found he breath intakes in one of the alice in wonderland clips almost too regular for their liking. but it turned out to be the human sample.  the fact that many of the experts we spoke to for this article struggled to tell the ai and human voices apart should not be seen as a failure in their abilities. rather it is a sign of just how good at imitating human voices ai has now become.  it is something that could have some worrying implications  says harrington.  i'm amazed at how the ai voices knew where to put false stats and hesitations  assuming they were not typed in by someone at the keyboard  he says. the ability for ai to communicate  in speech  ideas from an individual that might be completely at odds with the individual's real views is now complete  he says. that's the bit i find quite scary.  estudio santa rita distinguishing ai-generated speech from real human voices just by using our ears is becoming increasingly difficult (credit: estudio santa rita)estudio santa rita distinguishing ai-generated speech from real human voices just by using our ears is becoming increasingly difficult (credit: estudio santa rita)  there could  however  be another way of telling a human from an ai voice  harrington says. he suggests using something known as prosodic deaccenting. take the example below:  question: has john read hard times yet?  answer: john doesn't like dickens.  the emphasis on the verb in the answer signals that the person replying understands that dickens is the author of the novel  hard times.  the synthesis of these types of dialogue with a natural prosody might still be quite hard for many ai systems because it requires a knowledge of the world that goes well beyond the words printed on the page  says harrington.   but even this sort of test could soon be overcome by large language models drawing on large datasets from the internet as it trains itself to speak more human.  it would be really interesting to find out at some stage if ai gets that right as well  harrington adds.  mainstream services such as chatgpt's voice function can already laugh  whisper  be interrupted and then continue what it was saying. it can also remember everything you ever told it.  perhaps in the search to find out if you are speaking to a human  the solution is simple – spend more time meeting face to face when asked what safeguards were in place to ensure its ai would disclose that it is ai while conversing with humans  openai – the developers of chatgpt – said there were none. it also said it was not planning to watermark ai to identify it because of the potential for bias against its users. this could include groups of impaired speakers using chatgpt to communicate or it could include students using chatgpt to help with homework.  however  openai says it is actively trying to block voice cloning as chatgpt's advanced features roll out.  we work to prevent our synthetic voices from copying the voices of real people  chatgpt multimodal product lead jackie shannon tells the bbc. for advanced voice  in particular  we only allow the model to use the preset voices. these include two british-sounding and seven american-sounding voices  split between gender.   there are a couple of other tricks you could try if you have any doubts that the voice you are conversing with might not be human. you could  for example  ask it to scream. many of ai-voice systems struggle to speak outside the normal vocal range  unless they have been specifically trained to  said nicoletti. i asked chatgpt to shout and it told me it couldn't.  the flaws in human speech could be another give away  says grennan. correcting oneself and doubling back on one's thoughts  is a very human thing to do.  it's unlikely you'll ever hear chatgpt say   uh nevermind! or you know what!?  there are also moves to make deepfake detection software more readily available to consumers. mcafee  for example  has partnered with dell  hp  lenovo  samsung  acer and asus to pre-install their solution on ai enabled pcs. the company is also expecting to roll out its software to mobile devices in the near future  according to grobman.  elevenlabs – which is the maker of the tool that was used to create the ai voice clones in our alice in wonderland challenge – also offers a free ai detection tool to help people identify if its software has been used to create a piece of audio.  but in the inevitable arms race between ai generation and ai detection  we may find new value in something we have lost in our increasingly virtually connected world – physical interaction. perhaps in the search to find out if you are speaking to a human  the solution is simple – spend more time meeting face to face.  for those of you still puzzling over which of our audio clips was real  we can reveal that the first clip was ai while the second was human. were you able to guess correctly?,AI,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241122-ai-deepfakes-is-there-something-special-about-the-human-voice

45,Could AI help treat brain tumours in children?,researchers are investigating how ai could help identify new treatments for children with brain tumours.  although rare  about 420 children in the uk are diagnosed with brain cancer every year.  the team from the cancer research uk children’s brain tumour centre of excellence in cambridge will also look at how to improve survival rates.  youngsters with the most aggressive form of the disease are currently unlikely to survive beyond a year.   mousumi bakshi/bbc dr elizabeth cooper has tied back brown hair and brown eyes and is slightly smiling. she is wearing a white lab coat and is standing in front of medical testing equipment.mousumi bakshi/bbc dr cooper says immunotherapy has changed how we treat cancer but it doesn’t always work for brain tumours dr elizabeth cooper  one of the researchers working on the project  said that a child’s brain tumour is different to an adult tumour.  the brain changes all the time when kids are growing up  she said.  it could be one of the reasons why immunotherapy  which uses the body’s own immune system to help kill cancer cells  has had limited success in treating brain tumours.  immunotherapy has changed how we treat cancer but it doesn’t always work for brain tumours  dr cooper said.  what we’ve discovered is that the brain has its own immune system  but we don’t yet know how to use it.   mousumi bakshi/bbc children’s brain tumour centre of excellence co-director  prof richard gilbertson  has light brown greying hair and beard and wears brown framed glasses. he is wearing a light blue shirt with a brown spotted tie and is smiling without showing his teeth.mousumi bakshi/bbc prof richard gilbertson said new drugs were needed to treat the disease in children the group is in the early stages of trying to understand what that could mean for treatment  according to the centre’s co-director prof richard gilbertson.  we need to design new drugs to treat children’s disease  he said - medicines that were less toxic and harmful for children to endure.  the centre has been awarded a multi-million pound grant and part of the money will be spent on using artificial intelligence to create digital models of the most complex brain tumours.  prof gilbertson continued: we’ll be able to use the models to test our treatments in virtual clinical trials  and hopefully identify ones that are kinder for children  unlike radiotherapy for instance which can have pretty horrible side effects.,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3w35jd1gqo
46,Bid to fund AI camera on high risk Devon road,council officials want to use road safety funding to install an artificial intelligence [ai] camera on a road that was categorised as high risk of death and serious injury.  devon county council was awarded more than £5m in march from the department for transport’s safer roads fund to improve safety on the a361.  following evidence gathered during an ai camera pilot over the summer  it will bid to use £600 000 of that funding on the technology to target unsafe driving habits.  devon councillor stuart hughes  cabinet member for highways management  said the pilot revealed a high number of people driving without wearing a seatbelt or while using a mobile phone.   during the pilot 1 799 potential offences were detected over a four-week period.  these included 1 363 instances where a seat belt was not worn and 436 mobile phone distraction offences.  each is being reviewed by officers at vision zero south west  a partnership which includes devon and cornwall police and the council and aims to reduce serious and fatal collisions.  hughes  who is also vice chair of vision zero south west  said: i'm particularly keen on the use of the latest technology and innovation to target drivers with unsafe driving habits.  through using state-of-the-art technology  we want to reduce these dangerous driving practices and make our roads safer for everyone.  'penalty points' adrian leisk  head of road safety for devon and cornwall police said: we don’t use these camera systems to catch people  we use them to keep motorists safe by encouraging them to wear a seatbelt and not use their phones while driving.  but if you are caught  you can expect either a driver education course or a fine and penalty points.  the route in north devon between barnstaple and ilfracombe was one of 17 roads in england designated as high risk and received the highest amount of funding from the safer roads fund.  other improvements along the route such as speed management and junction upgrades as well as better pedestrian facilities  could also be made.,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxwreel5deo
47,'I massively regret using AI to cheat at uni',we had two deadlines really close together and i just ran out of steam  says hannah  a university student.  i felt incredibly stressed and just under enormous pressure to do well. i was really struggling and my brain had completely given up.  in her desperation - and also suffering with covid while facing the deadlines - she said she turned to artificial intelligence (ai) to help her write one of the essays.  hannah  not her real name  is now warning others about the potential consequences of using generative ai to cheat at university.   she faced an academic misconduct panel  who have the power to expel students found to be cheating.  her case highlights the challenge that universities face as they encourage students to become ai literate  whilst discouraging cheating.  hannah's misuse of ai was discovered when her lecturer routinely scanned her essay using detection software.  she said: my stomach was in knots and i was sitting outside the office. i was like 'this was really stupid'.  “when it got flagged  me and my tutor were sat looking through it and he said you were doing really well up until this point  and then it all went down hill from there.  “i’d been scored a zero and i then got an email from my tutor saying we think there’s been some academic misconduct.”  'kicked out' hannah added: “i think in my head initially i thought  'just deny it  don’t say anything'  but then i saw on the screen an ai percentage and it was quite high and i just lasted three minutes before i broke down and said i had used ai to help me finish the essay.  she was cleared as a panel ruled there wasn’t enough evidence against her  despite her having admitted using ai.  hannah said she thinks it was a slap on the wrist designed to serve as a warning to other students.  i could have been kicked out  she said.  “i do massively regret my choice  i was achieving really well  getting a lot of firsts  and i actually think that might have also been the problem  that i needed to maintain that level of grades  and it just kind of really pushed me into a place of using artificial intelligence.  “the fact it was my first year  that’s probably also part of the reason why they decided they weren’t going to take it any further.  “it felt really bad at the end of it  it really tainted that year for me.  what is ai? generative ai is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more human way.  it does this by taking in information from its surroundings  and deciding the best response based on what it learns.  universities have been trying to understand what ai applications are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used.    1:46 the bbc's ben moore writes an essay using ai  but will he be found out?  'embrace it' some universities ban the use of ai unless specifically authorised  while others allow ai to be used to identify errors in grammar or vocabulary  or permit generative ai content within assessments as long as it is fully cited and referenced.  at a bar on the outskirts of canterbury students here know the limits  and say they only use ai as an aid  like they might a search engine.  a student called taylor told us: you’ve got to embrace it. you can ask it questions and it helps you out.  you can use it to create a guide to structure your work. it’s good for exam prep too.  and fellow student zyren said she fell out with a friend who used it extensively.  they openly admitted to me they use ai  full on copied and pasted an essay they got from chat gpt. a part of me felt annoyed as it hit me that they might get a higher score than me.”  'potential risks' universities uk  an organisation of vice-chancellors and principals of universities  said: “universities are aware of the potential risks posed by ai tools in the context of exams and assessment.  [they] all have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own  engaging with students from day-one on the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.”  a department for education spokesperson said: generative ai has great potential to transform the higher education sector and provides exciting opportunities for growth. however  integrating it into teaching  learning  and assessment will require careful consideration.  “universities must determine how to harness the benefits and mitigate the risks to prepare students for the jobs of the future.,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04emrxp4xo
48,AI to help doctors spot broken bones on X-rays,artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to reduce the number of broken bones missed when doctors analyse x-rays  according to the national institute for health and care excellence (nice).  the health assessment body says research suggests the technology is safe and could speed up diagnosis  relieving pressure on clinicians and reducing the need for some follow-up appointments.  four ai tools are set to be recommended for use in urgent care in england while more evidence is collected on the benefits of the technology.  ai will not be working alone - each image will be reviewed by a healthcare professional.   nice says broken bones are missed in 3-10% of cases - it is the most common diagnostic error in emergency departments.  and the trained experts who perform and analyse thousands of x-ray images every day in the nhs are in short supply  with a huge workload.  vacancy rates are 12.5% for radiologists and 15% for radiographers  according to the long-term plan for the nhs in england.  the solution  according to nice  is to harness the power of ai to work alongside clinicians.  mark chapman  director of health technology at nice  said it would make their job easier.  “these ai technologies are safe to use and could spot fractures which humans might miss  given the pressure and demands these professional groups work under  he said.  mr chapman said ai tools could also potentially speed up diagnosis and reduce the number of follow-up appointments needed because of a fracture missed during an initial assessment.  nice said it was unlikely the technology would lead to a rise in incorrect diagnoses or unnecessary referrals to fracture clinics because a radiologist would always review the x-ray images.  the process would be better than a clinician looking at images on their own  it said.  the potential for using artificial intelligence in healthcare is huge.  it is being used already to help detect the earliest signs of breast cancer on scans  spot who is most at risk of heart attacks and predict when the next pandemic will happen.  a consultation on the draft nice guidance on this use of ai will end on 5 november.,AI,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2060gy9zy1o
49,New AI training techniques aim to overcome current challenges,openai and other leading ai companies are developing new training techniques to overcome limitations of current methods. addressing unexpected delays and complications in the development of larger  more powerful language models  these fresh techniques focus on human-like behaviour to teach algorithms to ‘think.  reportedly led by a dozen ai researchers  scientists  and investors  the new training techniques  which underpin openai’s recent ‘o1’ model (formerly q* and strawberry)  have the potential to transform the landscape of ai development. the reported advances may influence the types or quantities of resources ai companies need continuously  including specialised hardware and energy to aid the development of ai models.  the o1 model is designed to approach problems in a way that mimics human reasoning and thinking  breaking down numerous tasks into steps. the model also utilises specialised data and feedback provided by experts in the ai industry to enhance its performance.  since chatgpt was unveiled by openai in 2022  there has been a surge in ai innovation  and many technology companies claim existing ai models require expansion  be it through greater quantities of data or improved computing resources. only then can ai models consistently improve.  now  ai experts have reported limitations in scaling up ai models. the 2010s were a revolutionary period for scaling  but ilya sutskever  co-founder of ai labs safe superintelligence (ssi) and openai  says that the training of ai models  particularly in the understanding language structures and patterns  has levelled off.  “the 2010s were the age of scaling  now we’re back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. scaling the right thing matters more now ” they said.  in recent times  ai lab researchers have experienced delays in and challenges to developing and releasing large language models (llm) that are more powerful than openai’s gpt-4 model.  first  there is the cost of training large models  often running into tens of millions of dollars. and  due to complications that arise  like hardware failing due to system complexity  a final analysis of how these models run can take months.  in addition to these challenges  training runs require substantial amounts of energy  often resulting in power shortages that can disrupt processes and impact the wider electriciy grid. another issue is the colossal amount of data large language models use  so much so that ai models have reportedly used up all accessible data worldwide.  researchers are exploring a technique known as ‘test-time compute’ to improve current ai models when being trained or during inference phases. the method can involve the generation of multiple answers in real-time to decide on a range of best solutions. therefore  the model can allocate greater processing resources to difficult tasks that require human-like decision-making and reasoning. the aim – to make the model more accurate and capable.  noam brown  a researcher at openai who helped develop the o1 model  shared an example of how a new approach can achieve surprising results. at the ted ai conference in san francisco last month  brown explained that “having a bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of poker got the same boosting performance as scaling up the model by 100 000x and training it for 100 000 times longer.”  rather than simply increasing the model size and training time  this can change how ai models process information and lead to more powerful  efficient systems.  it is reported that other ai labs have been developing versions of the o1 technique. the include xai  google deepmind  and anthropic. competition in the ai world is nothing new  but we could see a significant impact on the ai hardware market as a result of new techniques. companies like nvidia  which currently dominates the supply of ai chips due to the high demand for their products  may be particularly affected by updated ai training techniques.  nvidia became the world’s most valuable company in october  and its rise in fortunes can be largely attributed to its chips’ use in ai arrays. new techniques may impact nvidia’s market position  forcing the company to adapt its products to meet the evolving ai hardware demand. potentially  this could open more avenues for new competitors in the inference market.  a new age of ai development may be on the horizon  driven by evolving hardware demands and more efficient training methods such as those deployed in the o1 model. the future of both ai models and the companies behind them could be reshaped  unlocking unprecedented possibilities and greater competition.  see also: anthropic urges ai regulation to avoid catastrophes   want to learn more about ai and big data from industry leaders?

50,Alibaba Marco-o1: Advancing LLM reasoning capabilities,alibaba has announced marco-o1  a large language model (llm) designed to tackle both conventional and open-ended problem-solving tasks.  marco-o1  from alibaba’s marcopolo team  represents another step forward in the ability of ai to handle complex reasoning challenges—particularly in maths  physics  coding  and areas where clear standards may be absent.  building upon openai’s reasoning advancements with its o1 model  marco-o1 distinguishes itself by incorporating several advanced techniques  including chain-of-thought (cot) fine-tuning  monte carlo tree search (mcts)  and novel reflection mechanisms. these components work in concert to enhance the model’s problem-solving capabilities across various domains.  the development team has implemented a comprehensive fine-tuning strategy using multiple datasets  including a filtered version of the open-o1 cot dataset  a synthetic marco-o1 cot dataset  and a specialised marco instruction dataset. in total  the training corpus comprises over 60 000 carefully curated samples.  the model has demonstrated particularly impressive results in multilingual applications. in testing  marco-o1 achieved notable accuracy improvements of 6.17% on the english mgsm dataset and 5.60% on its chinese counterpart. the model has shown particular strength in translation tasks  especially when handling colloquial expressions and cultural nuances.  one of the model’s most innovative features is its implementation of varying action granularities within the mcts framework. this approach allows the model to explore reasoning paths at different levels of detail  from broad steps to more precise “mini-steps” of 32 or 64 tokens. the team has also introduced a reflection mechanism that prompts the model to self-evaluate and reconsider its reasoning  leading to improved accuracy in complex problem-solving scenarios.  the mcts integration has proven particularly effective  with all mcts-enhanced versions of the model showing significant improvements over the base marco-o1-cot version. the team’s experiments with different action granularities have revealed interesting patterns  though they note that determining the optimal strategy requires further research and more precise reward models.  benchmark comparison of the latest marco-o1 llm model with mcts integration to previous ai models and variations. (credit: marcopolo team  ai business  alibaba international digital commerce) the development team has been transparent about the model’s current limitations  acknowledging that while marco-o1 exhibits strong reasoning characteristics  it still falls short of a fully realised “o1” model. they emphasise that this release represents an ongoing commitment to improvement rather than a finished product.  looking ahead  the alibaba team has announced plans to incorporate reward models  including outcome reward modeling (orm) and process reward modeling (prm)  to enhance the decision-making capabilities og marco-o1. they are also exploring reinforcement learning techniques to further refine the model’s problem-solving abilities.  the marco-o1 model and associated datasets have been made available to the research community through alibaba’s github repository  complete with comprehensive documentation and implementation guides. the release includes installation instructions and example scripts for both direct model usage and deployment via fastapi.,AI,https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/alibaba-marco-o1-advancing-llm-reasoning-capabilities/
51,OpenAI enhances AI safety with new red teaming methods,a critical part of openai’s safeguarding process is “red teaming” — a structured methodology using both human and ai participants to explore potential risks and vulnerabilities in new systems.  historically  openai has engaged in red teaming efforts predominantly through manual testing  which involves individuals probing for weaknesses. this was notably employed during the testing of their dall·e 2 image generation model in early 2022  where external experts were invited to identify potential risks. since then  openai has expanded and refined its methodologies  incorporating automated and mixed approaches for a more comprehensive risk assessment.  “we are optimistic that we can use more powerful ai to scale the discovery of model mistakes ” openai stated. this optimism is rooted in the idea that automated processes can help evaluate models and train them to be safer by recognising patterns and errors on a larger scale.  in their latest push for advancement  openai is sharing two important documents on red teaming — a white paper detailing external engagement strategies and a research study introducing a novel method for automated red teaming. these contributions aim to strengthen the process and outcomes of red teaming  ultimately leading to safer and more responsible ai implementations.  as ai continues to evolve  understanding user experiences and identifying risks such as abuse and misuse are crucial for researchers and developers. red teaming provides a proactive method for evaluating these risks  especially when supplemented by insights from a range of independent external experts. this approach not only helps establish benchmarks but also facilitates the enhancement of safety evaluations over time.  the human touch openai has shared four fundamental steps in their white paper  “openai’s approach to external red teaming for ai models and systems ” to design effective red teaming campaigns:  composition of red teams: the selection of team members is based on the objectives of the campaign. this often involves individuals with diverse perspectives  such as expertise in natural sciences  cybersecurity  and regional politics  ensuring assessments cover the necessary breadth. access to model versions: clarifying which versions of a model red teamers will access can influence the outcomes. early-stage models may reveal inherent risks  while more developed versions can help identify gaps in planned safety mitigations. guidance and documentation: effective interactions during campaigns rely on clear instructions  suitable interfaces  and structured documentation. this involves describing the models  existing safeguards  testing interfaces  and guidelines for recording results. data synthesis and evaluation: post-campaign  the data is assessed to determine if examples align with existing policies or require new behavioural modifications. the assessed data then informs repeatable evaluations for future updates. a recent application of this methodology involved preparing the openai o1 family of models for public use—testing their resistance to potential misuse and evaluating their application across various fields such as real-world attack planning  natural sciences  and ai research.  automated red teaming automated red teaming seeks to identify instances where ai may fail  particularly regarding safety-related issues. this method excels at scale  generating numerous examples of potential errors quickly. however  traditional automated approaches have struggled with producing diverse  successful attack strategies.  openai’s research introduces “diverse and effective red teaming with auto-generated rewards and multi-step reinforcement learning ” a method which encourages greater diversity in attack strategies while maintaining effectiveness.  this method involves using ai to generate different scenarios  such as illicit advice  and training red teaming models to evaluate these scenarios critically. the process rewards diversity and efficacy  promoting more varied and comprehensive safety evaluations.  despite its benefits  red teaming does have limitations. it captures risks at a specific point in time  which may evolve as ai models develop. additionally  the red teaming process can inadvertently create information hazards  potentially alerting malicious actors to vulnerabilities not yet widely known. managing these risks requires stringent protocols and responsible disclosures.  while red teaming continues to be pivotal in risk discovery and evaluation  openai acknowledges the necessity of incorporating broader public perspectives on ai’s ideal behaviours and policies to ensure the technology aligns with societal values and expectations.  see also: eu introduces draft regulatory guidance for ai models,AI,https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-enhances-ai-safety-new-red-teaming-methods/

55,OpenAI faces diminishing returns with latest AI model,openai is facing diminishing returns with its latest ai model while navigating the pressures of recent investments.  according to the information  openai’s next ai model – codenamed orion – is delivering smaller performance gains compared to its predecessors.  in employee testing  orion reportedly achieved the performance level of gpt-4 after completing just 20% of its training. however  the transition from gpt-4 to the anticipated gpt-5 is said to exhibit smaller quality improvements than the leap from gpt-3 to gpt-4.  “some researchers at the company believe orion isn’t reliably better than its predecessor in handling certain tasks ” stated employees in the report. “orion performs better at language tasks but may not outperform previous models at tasks such as coding  according to an openai employee.”  early stages of ai training usually yield the most significant improvements  while subsequent phases typically result in smaller performance gains. consequently  the remaining 80% of training is unlikely to deliver advancements on par with previous generational improvements.  this situation with its latest ai model emerges at a pivotal time for openai  following a recent funding round that saw the company raise $6.6 billion. with this financial backing comes increased expectations from investors  as well as technical challenges that complicate traditional scaling methodologies in ai development.  if these early versions do not meet expectations  openai’s future fundraising prospects may not attract the same level of interest.  the limitations highlighted in the report underline a significant challenge confronting the entire ai industry: the diminishing availability of high-quality training data and the necessity to maintain relevance in an increasingly competitive field.  according to a paper (pdf) that was published in june  ai firms will deplete the pool of publicly available human-generated text data between 2026 and 2032. the information notes that developers have “”largely squeezed as much out of” the data that has been used for enabling the rapid ai advancements we’ve seen in recent years.  to address these challenges  openai is fundamentally rethinking its ai development strategy.  “in response to the recent challenge to training-based scaling laws posed by slowing gpt improvements  the industry appears to be shifting its effort to improving models after their initial training  potentially yielding a different type of scaling law ” explains the information.  as openai navigates these challenges  the company must balance innovation with practical application and investor expectations. however  the ongoing exodus of leading figures from the company won’t help matters.,AI,https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-faces-diminishing-returns-latest-ai-model/
56,Nvidia Reveals ‘Swiss Army Knife’ of AI Audio Tools: Fugatto,high-powered computer chip maker nvidia on monday unveiled a new ai model developed by its researchers that can generate or transform any mix of music  voices and sounds described with prompts using any combination of text and audio files.  the new ai model called fugatto — for foundational generative audio transformer opus — can create a music snippet based on a text prompt  remove or add instruments from an existing song  change the accent or emotion in a voice  and even produce sounds never heard before.  according to nvidia  by supporting numerous audio generation and transformation tasks  fugatto is the first foundational generative ai model that showcases emergent properties — capabilities that arise from the interaction of its various trained abilities — and the ability to combine free-form instructions.  “we wanted to create a model that understands and generates sound like humans do ” rafael valle  a manager of applied audio research at nvidia  said in a statement.  “fugatto is our first step toward a future where unsupervised multitask learning in audio synthesis and transformation emerges from data and model scale ” he added.  nvidia noted the model is capable of handling tasks it was not pretrained on  as well as generating sounds that change over time  such as the doppler effect of thunder as a rainstorm passes through an area.  the company added that unlike most models  which can only recreate the training data they’ve been exposed to  fugatto allows users to create soundscapes it’s never seen before  such as a thunderstorm easing into dawn with the sound of birds singing.  breakthrough ai model for audio transformation “nvidia’s introduction of fugatto marks a significant advancement in ai-driven audio technology ” observed kaveh vahdat  founder and president of riseopp  a national cmo services company based in san francisco.  “unlike existing models that specialize in specific tasks — such as music composition  voice synthesis  or sound effect generation — fugatto offers a unified framework capable of handling a diverse array of audio-related functions ” he told technewsworld. “this versatility positions it as a comprehensive tool for audio synthesis and transformation.”  get the details you need to choose the right ccaas to offer exceptional cx vahdat explained that fugatto distinguishes itself through its ability to generate and transform audio based on both text instructions and optional audio inputs. “this dual-input approach enables users to create complex audio outputs that seamlessly blend various elements  such as combining a saxophone’s melody with the timbre of a meowing cat ” he said.  additionally  he continued  fugatto’s capacity to interpolate between instructions allows for nuanced control over attributes like accent and emotion in voice synthesis  offering a level of customization not commonly found in current ai audio tools.  “fugatto is an extraordinary step towards ai that can handle multiple modalities simultaneously ” added benjamin lee  a professor of engineering at the university of pennsylvania.  “using both text and audio inputs together may produce far more efficient or effective models than using text alone ” he told technewsworld. “the technology is interesting because  looking beyond text alone  it broadens the volumes of training data and the capabilities of generative ai models.”    nvidia at its best mark n. vena  president and principal analyst at smarttech research in las vegas  asserted that fugatto represents nvidia at its best.  “the technology introduces advanced capabilities in ai audio processing by enabling the transformation of existing audio into entirely new forms ” he told technewsworld. “this includes converting a piano melody into a human vocal line or altering the accent and emotional tone of spoken words  offering unprecedented flexibility in audio manipulation.”  “unlike existing ai audio tools  fugatto can generate novel sounds from text descriptions  such as making a trumpet sound like a barking dog ” he said. “these features provide creators in music  film  and gaming with innovative tools for sound design and audio editing.”  fugatto deals with audio holistically — spanning sound effects  music  voice  virtually any type of audio  including sounds that have not been heard before — and precisely  added ross rubin  the principal analyst with reticle research  a consumer technology advisory firm in new york city.  he cited the example of suno  a service that uses ai to generate songs. “they just released a new version that has improvements in how generated human voices sound and other things  but it doesn’t allow the kinds of precise  creative changes that fugatto allows  such as adding new instruments to a mix  changing moods from happy to sad  or moving a song from a minor key to a major key ” he told technewsworld.  “its understanding of the world of audio and the flexibility that it offers goes beyond the mask-specific engines that we’ve seen for things like generating a human voice or generating a song ” he said.  opens door for creatives vahdat pointed out that fugatto can be useful in both advertising and language learning. agencies can create customized audio content that aligns with brand identities  including voiceovers with specific accents or emotional tones  he noted.  at the same time  in language learning  educational platforms will be able to develop personalized audio materials  such as dialogues in various accents or emotional contexts  to aid in language acquisition.  “fugatto technology opens doors to a wide array of applications in creative industries ” vena maintained. “filmmakers and game developers can use it to create unique soundscapes  such as turning everyday sounds into fantastical or immersive effects ” he said. “it also holds potential for personalized audio experiences in virtual reality  assistive technologies  and education  tailoring sounds to specific emotional tones or user preferences.”  automate your customer service at scale “in music production ” he added  “it can transform instruments or vocal styles to explore innovative compositions.”  further development may be needed to get better musical results  however. “all these results are trivial  and some have been around for longer — and better ” observed dennis bathory-kitsz  a musician and composer in northfield falls  vt.  “the voice isolation was clumsy and unmusical ” he told technewsworld. “the additional instruments were also trivial  and most of the transformations were colorless. the only advantage is that it requires no particular learning  so the development of musicality for the ai user will be minimal.”  “it may usher in some new uses — real musicians are wonderfully inventive already — but unless the developers have better musical chops to begin with  the results will be dreary ” he said. “they will be musical slop to join the visual and verbal slop from ai.”  agi stand-in with artificial general intelligence (agi) still very much in the future  fugatto may be a model for simulating agi  which ultimately aims to replicate or surpass human cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks.  “fugatto is part of a solution that uses generative ai in a collaborative bundle with other ai tools to create an agi-like solution ” explained rob enderle  president and principal analyst at the enderle group  an advisory services firm in bend  ore.  “until we get agi working ” he told technewsworld  “this approach will be the dominant way to create more complete ai projects with far higher quality and interest.”,AI,https://www.technewsworld.com/story/nvidia-reveals-swiss-army-knife-of-ai-audio-tools-fugatto-179478.html
57,Preparing today for tomorrow’s AI regulations,ai is rapidly becoming ubiquitous across business systems and it ecosystems  with adoption and development racing faster than anyone could have expected. today it seems that everywhere we turn  software engineers are building custom models and integrating ai into their products  as business leaders incorporate ai-powered solutions in their working environments.  however  uncertainty about the best way to implement ai is stopping some companies from taking action. boston consulting group’s latest digital acceleration index (dai)  a global survey of 2 700 executives  revealed that only 28% say their organisation is fully prepared for new ai regulation.  their uncertainty is exacerbated by ai regulations arriving thick and fast: the eu ai act is on the way; argentina released a draft ai plan; canada has the ai and data act; china has enacted a slew of ai regulations; and the g7 nations launched the “hiroshima ai process.” guidelines abound  with the oecd developing ai principles  the un proposing a new un ai advisory body  and the biden administration releasing a blueprint for an ai bill of rights (although that could quickly change with the second trump administration).  legislation is also coming in individual us states  and is appearing in many industry frameworks. to date  21 states have enacted laws to regulate ai use in some manner  including the colourado ai act  and clauses in california’s ccpa  plus a further 14 states have legislation awaiting approval.  meanwhile  there are loud voices on both sides of the ai regulation debate. a new survey from solarwinds shows 88% of it professionals advocate for stronger regulation  and separate research reveals that 91% of british people want the government to do more to hold businesses accountable for their ai systems. on the other hand  the leaders of over 50 tech companies recently wrote an open letter calling for urgent reform of the eu’s heavy ai regulations  arguing that they stifle innovation.  it’s certainly a tricky period for business leaders and software developers  as regulators scramble to catch up with tech. of course you want to take advantage of the benefits ai can provide  you can do so in a way that sets you up for compliance with whatever regulatory requirements are coming  and don’t handicap your ai use unnecessarily while your rivals speed ahead.  we don’t have a crystal ball  so we can’t predict the future. but we can share some best practices for setting up systems and procedures that will prepare the ground for ai regulatory compliance.  map out ai usage in your wider ecosystem you can’t manage your team’s ai use unless you know about it  but that alone can be a significant challenge. shadow it is already the scourge of cybersecurity teams: employees sign up for saas tools without the knowledge of it departments  leaving an unknown number of solutions and platforms with access to business data and/or systems.  now security teams also have to grapple with shadow ai. many apps  chatbots  and other tools incorporate ai  machine learning (ml)  or natural language programming (nlp)  without such solutions necessarily being obvious ai solutions. when employees log into these solutions without official approval  they bring ai into your systems without your knowledge.  as opice blum’s data privacy expert henrique fabretti moraes explained  “mapping the tools in use – or those intended for use – is crucial for understanding and fine-tuning acceptable use policies and potential mitigation measures to decrease the risks involved in their utilisation.”  some regulations hold you responsible for ai use by vendors. to take full control of the situation  you need to map all the ai in your  and your partner organisations’ environments. in this regard  using a tool like harmonic can be instrumental in detecting ai use across the supply chain.  verify data governance data privacy and security are core concerns for all ai regulations  both those already in place and those on the brink of approval.  your ai use already needs to comply with existing privacy laws like gdpr and ccpr  which require you to know what data your ai can access and what it does with the data  and for you to demonstrate guardrails to protect the data ai uses.  to ensure compliance  you need to put robust data governance rules into place in your organisation  managed by a defined team  and backed up by regular audits. your policies should include due diligence to evaluate data security and sources of all your tools  including those that use ai  to identify areas of potential bias and privacy risk.  “it is incumbent on organisations to take proactive measures by enhancing data hygiene  enforcing robust ai ethics and assembling the right teams to lead these efforts ” said rob johnson  vp and global head of solutions engineering at solarwinds. “this proactive stance not only helps with compliance with evolving regulations but also maximises the potential of ai.”  establish continuous monitoring for your ai systems effective monitoring is crucial for managing any area of your business. when it comes to ai  as with other areas of cybersecurity  you need continuous monitoring to ensure that you know what your ai tools are doing  how they are behaving  and what data they are accessing. you also need to audit them regularly to keep on top of ai use in your organisation.  “the idea of using ai to monitor and regulate other ai systems is a crucial development in ensuring these systems are both effective and ethical ” said cache merrill  founder of software development company zibtek. “currently  techniques like machine learning models that predict other models’ behaviours (meta-models) are employed to monitor ai. the systems analyse patterns and outputs of operational ai to detect anomalies  biases or potential failures before they become critical.”  cyber grc automation platform cypago allows you to run continuous monitoring and regulatory audit evidence collection in the background. the no-code automation allows you to set custom workflow capabilities without technical expertise  so alerts and mitigation actions are triggered instantly according to the controls and thresholds you set up.  cypago can connect with your various digital platforms  synchronise with virtually any regulatory framework  and turn all relevant controls into automated workflows. once your integrations and regulatory frameworks are set up  creating custom workflows on the platform is as simple as uploading a spreadsheet.  use risk assessments as your guidelines it’s vital to know which of your ai tools are high risk  medium risk  and low risk – for compliance with external regulations  for internal business risk management  and for improving software development workflows. high risk use cases will need more safeguards and evaluation before deployment.  “while ai risk management can be started at any point in the project development ” ayesha gulley  an ai policy expert from holistic ai  said. “implementing a risk management framework sooner than later can help enterprises increase trust and scale with confidence.”  when you know the risks posed by different ai solutions  you can choose the level of access you’ll grant them to data and critical business systems.  in terms of regulations  the eu ai act already distinguishes between ai systems with different risk levels  and nist recommends assessing ai tools based on trustworthiness  social impact  and how humans interact with the system.  proactively set ai ethics governance you don’t need to wait for ai regulations to set up ethical ai policies. allocate responsibility for ethical ai considerations  put together teams  and draw up policies for ethical ai use that include cybersecurity  model validation  transparency  data privacy  and incident reporting.  plenty of existing frameworks like nist’s ai rmf and iso/iec 42001 recommend ai best practices that you can incorporate into your policies.  “regulating ai is both necessary and inevitable to ensure ethical and responsible use. while this may introduce complexities  it need not hinder innovation ” said arik solomon  ceo and co-founder of cypago. “by integrating compliance into their internal frameworks and developing policies and processes aligned with regulatory principles  companies in regulated industries can continue to grow and innovate effectively.”  companies that can demonstrate a proactive approach to ethical ai will be better positioned for compliance. ai regulations aim to ensure transparency and data privacy  so if your goals align with these principles  you’ll be more likely to have policies in place that comply with future regulation. the fairnow platform can help with this process  with tools for managing ai governance  bias checks  and risk assessments in a single location.  don’t let fear of ai regulation hold you back ai regulations are still evolving and emerging  creating uncertainty for businesses and developers. but don’t let the fluid situation stop you from benefiting from ai. by proactively implementing policies  workflows  and tools that align with the principles of data privacy  transparency  and ethical use  you can prepare for ai regulations and take advantage of ai-powered possibilities,AI,https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/preparing-today-for-tomorrows-ai-regulations/
58,Ultra-processed Foods Drive Obesity  But a Mediterranean Diet May Help,a new study finds that higher ultra-processed food (upf) intake is associated with an increased body mass index (bmi). the link between upfs and higher bmi was most pronounced for soda consumption. the findings also demonstrate how adherence to the mediterranean diet may impact bmi. the study is relatively small but builds on existing evidence showing the health dangers of consuming ultra-processed foods. although ultra-processed food (upf) is a relatively new term  it has already become a household name. every new study makes it clearer that many of these products are harmful to human health.  the latest in a long line of studies shows that people who consume more upfs are more likely to have a higher bmi and increased adiposity — the amount of excess fat an individual has.  the italian study  recently published in the journal nutrients  also shows that people who follow the mediterranean diet the least closely are more likely to have a higher bmi.   ultra-processed foods linked to higher bmi  obesity for this study  researchers recruited 175 people with obesity  all of whom completed a food diary  providing information about their upf intake and how closely they followed the mediterranean diet. the scientists also measured their body composition and bmi.  according to their analysis: “the data showed an increase in upf consumption as the bmi increased.”  in other words  individuals who consumed the highest amounts of upfs were more likely to have a higher bmi. at the same time  as upf intake increased  adherence to the mediterranean diet decreased.  the scientists found that some upfs were more closely linked to bmi and adiposity than others  notably soda. this is not the first time soda has been singled out.  although the recent study is relatively small  it is yet more evidence that reducing upf intake — particularly soda — is probably a smart move for health.  “the study confirmed what we emphasize to our weight loss patients: focus on adding lean proteins and vegetables to the diet ” mir ali  md  a board certified general surgeon  bariatric surgeon  and medical director of memorialcare surgical weight loss center at orange coast medical center in fountain valley  ca  told healthline.  “the more processed the food ” he continued  “the more it stimulates insulin secretion and fat deposition.”  ali noted that “processed foods take less energy to break down and make the person feel hungry sooner.” he also told us that highly processed foods can trigger addictive eating behaviors. “for all these reasons  limiting upfs can greatly help a person in their weight loss efforts ” he said.   ultra-processed foods linked to multiple chronic diseases in the united states  more than half of calories consumed are in the form of ultra-processed foods (upfs).  according to nova  the most commonly used classification system for food processing  upfs are:  “industrially manufactured food products made up of several ingredients (formulations) including sugar  oils  fats  and salt (generally in combination and in higher amounts than in processed foods) and food substances of no or rare culinary use (such as high-fructose corn syrup  hydrogenated oils  modified starches  and protein isolates).”  this means upfs tend to contain large quantities of sugar  fat  and a list of ingredients you would not find in a standard home kitchen. upfs are produced industrially  are relatively low cost  and have a long shelf life  all of which make them convenient for the customer and the manufacturer. importantly  they’re also highly palatable and easy to overeat.  in recent years  researchers have linked higher intakes of upfs to a host of chronic health conditions  including diabetes  cancer  and heart disease.  for instance  a recent studytrusted source found that greater upf intake was associated with type 2 diabetes. however  when the researchers broke down their analysis by food type  not all upfs were as tightly linked to the condition. the closest ties were with sodas  savory snacks  animal-based products  and ready-to-eat dishes.  additionally  there may be a link between highly processed foods and mental health conditions like depressiontrusted source.  because of the growing evidence that upfs are closely linked to worse health outcomes  many experts are calling for stricter regulations on these foods  like sugar taxes and warning labels on packages. however  it remains to be seen whether such restrictions in the ultra-processed food industry will take effect.   reducing ultra-processed food intake the results of the recent study echo other research on the benefits of a mediterranean diet for overall health and weight management.  federica amati  phd  mph  a postdoctoral medical scientist and registered public health nutritionist with the association for nutrition (afn)  suggested making dietary changes slowly  particularly when it comes to reducing ultra-processed food intake.  “it’s clear that certain upfs are worse for our health than others  so if you’re looking to cut down  start with the worst offender: soda. the evidence of links between high intakes of soda and poor health outcomes is now overwhelming. so  if you can cut it out of your diet  you’ll be doing your health a huge favor ” amati told healthline.  she recommended replacing soda with water with optional added fruit. “or even better  switch to kombucha — a type of fermented tea  which contains live microbes. we know that fermented foods are likely to support your gut health and overall health ” she suggested.  “if you’re cutting back on your upf intake ” amati continued  “you don’t have to forgo all of your favorite foods — you can still enjoy chocolate  for instance.” she suggested looking for products that are at least 75% cocoa with as few ingredients on the label as possible.  “dark chocolate ” she explained  “is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial plant compounds. so  if you choose the right kind  and eat it in moderation  it can actually benefit your health.”  “finally  chips are high in salt and fat and contain no useful nutrients. i suggest swapping these for minimally processed popcorn. because popcorn is made from whole grains  it contains nutrients  including fiber  which most of us don’t consume nearly enough of.”  “just make sure you select a product that doesn’t contain a raft of additives  sugar  and salt ” she advised.  if you’re interested in learning more about the benefits of the mediterranean diet or need additional guidance for reducing your intake of upfs  talk with your doctor for further guidance.   takeaway a new study shows increased upf intake is associated with higher bmi and greater overall adiposity.  although the study is relatively small  it adds to the growing evidence that overall upf intake — particularly soda intake — is linked to worse health outcomes.  “at the moment  most of us eat around 60% of our calories as upfs ” amati said. “removing those products entirely would be nearly impossible  especially if we tried to do it all at once. instead  make small sustainable changes  with the goal of reducing your total energy intake to around 20% from upfs.”  “a good place to start is by replacing the upfs that are highest in energy  like sodas and pastries ” amati concluded.,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ultra-processed-foods-obesity-metabolic-risks
59,Irregular Sleep-Wake Cycles May Raise Heart Attack  Stroke Risk by 26%,sleep regularity (waking up and going to bed at the same time every day) could be more important than sleep duration in predicting heart attack and stroke. a new study found that even when individuals got enough sleep  irregular sleep patterns increased their risk of cardiovascular events. conversely  more sleep regularity was protective against heart attack and stroke. if you regularly wake up and go to bed at different times  you could be at increased risk of heart attack and stroke.  according to new research in the journal of epidemiology & community health  sleep regularity  or how often you stick to the same sleeping and waking schedule  appears to be a stronger predictor of major cardiovascular events than sleep duration.  it is the first study of its kind to look at the effects of both sleep duration and sleep regularity on cardiovascular disease.  the authors found that the risk of heart attack  stroke  and heart failure all increased significantly in people with irregular sleep patterns  even if they got the recommended number of hours of sleep for their age.  conversely  individuals who adhered most strongly to a regular sleep and wake schedule had a lower risk of major cardiovascular events.  “sleep irregularity refers to frequently changing sleep schedules  like going to bed and waking up at different times each day  which can disrupt the body and negatively impact health. this research emphasizes the importance of prioritizing sleep regularity in public health guidelines and clinical care to support cardiovascular health ” jean-philippe chaput  phd  a senior scientist at the children’s hospital of eastern ontario research institute and first author of the research  told healthline.   higher risk of cardiovascular event among irregular sleepers the large study included more than 72 000 individuals between the ages of 40 and 79 with no history of major cardiovascular events.  all participants were part of the uk biobank cohort  a biomedical database that includes de-identified data from half a million individuals in the united kingdom.  sleep is complex  so researchers attempted to control for a wide variety of factors that could affect the study’s outcomes  including age  sex  ethnicity  history of cardiovascular disease  and mental health. they also included important aspects of lifestyle that could affect sleep quality  such as self-reported sleep problems  whether or not the individual worked odd hours (night shifts)  and even screen time.  another strength of the study is that it did not rely on self-reported sleep data. participants utilized activity trackers for seven days to record their sleep.  based on the recorded sleep data  participants were given a “sleep regularity index” (sri) score; lower scores indicate irregular sleep patterns. individuals in the cohort were further stratified according to their sri score into three groups:  regular: sri of greater than 87.3 moderately irregular: sri of 71.6 to 87.3 irregular: sri of less than 71.6 the study found that irregular sleepers had a 26% increased risk of major cardiovascular events  and moderate irregular sleepers had a modest increase of 8%.  the next question for researchers was whether or not getting sufficient sleep could offset the risk of irregular sleep.  unfortunately  they found that even getting the recommended number of hours wasn’t enough to reduce risk for irregular sleepers  but it did have an effect on those in the moderately irregular group.  “while both adequate sleep duration and regular sleep patterns are important  our findings show that meeting sleep duration recommendations alone does not eliminate the increased mace risk for those with irregular sleep schedules ” said chaput.  in fact  regular sleep patterns were actually found to be protective against cardiovascular outcomes.  a minimum sri score of 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in risk  with even greater benefit occurring with more regular sleep: an sri of 80.8 yielded an 18% reduction.   dangers of irregular sleep-wake cycles while research has tended to focus on sleep duration  sleep regularity has consistently been linked to a host of negative health outcomes.  a 2023 study published in sleep found that sleep regularity was a stronger predictor of overall mortality risk than sleep duration. participants with higher sri scores had as much as a 48% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those with the lowest sri scores.  andrew j. k. phillips  md  a sleep scientist and associate professor at the flinders university college of medicine and public health  was the senior author of that study.  he told healthline that this novel research on cardiovascular outcomes is consistent with his own research.  “there is a strong emerging body of evidence from not only my group but many research groups around the world showing that irregular sleep patterns are bad for our health. what we are seeing is that sleep regularity is not just a predictor of one area of health  but rather it seems to touch on a wide range of health outcomes  from mortality to diabetes to mental health ” phillips said.  phillips also authored a 2017 studytrusted source that found that irregular sleeping was associated with poorer academic performance.  “irregular sleep patterns likely lead to disruption of the body’s network of circadian (24-hour) clocks. these clocks regulate the timing of all kinds of physiological functions throughout the body  including cell metabolism ” he said.   how to establish a regular sleep schedule getting on a regular sleep schedule is within reach but may take some adjustments.  “the beauty of this study is that its findings are immediately actionable. the very best way to keep a consistent sleep schedule is to wake up at or near the same time every day ” scott kutscher  md  a clinical associate professor of psychiatry and sleep medicine at stanford medicine  told healthline.  kutscher recommended helpful tips including:  setting a bedtime timer creating a wind-down routine (doing the same things every day before bed) talking with a healthcare professional if you think you may have a sleep disorder “even if your sleep patterns are highly irregular — say a shift worker — think about creating as much overlap in your sleep schedules as possible ” he added.  other steps for setting a consistent sleep schedule include:  limiting caffeine intake avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime limiting screen time before bed reducing noise making your bedroom “sleep ready” by keeping it dark  quiet  and cool “aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day  even on weekends. if you struggle with consistency  start by gradually adjusting your sleep and wake times in small increments until you establish a stable routine ” said chaput.   takeaway in a study of more than 72 000 people  individuals who had irregular sleep schedules (getting up and going to bed at different times every day) had a higher risk of major cardiovascular event outcomes  such as heart attack and stroke.  getting enough sleep  based on recommendations by age group  wasn’t enough to offset these risks in individuals with irregular sleep patterns.  the study is the first to examine the combined impact of sleep duration and sleep regularity on major cardiovascular event outcomes.  to create a regular sleep schedule  experts recommend getting up and going to sleep at the same times every day  including weekends  limiting screen time before sleep  and creating a wind-down routine leading up to bedtime.,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/irregular-sleep-wake-cycles-heart-attack-stroke-risk
60,TikTok’s Viral Mac and Cheese: Simple Hacks to Make It Healthier,a mac and cheese recipe has gone viral on tiktok with over 13.2 million likes. fans say this cheesy  carby dish is worth the hype. however  experts note that it has over 1600 calories per serving. the dish also contains double the recommended daily fat intake and double the recommended sodium allowance. nutritionists say several healthy hacks can help improve the dish’s nutritional value  including adding vegetables and swapping some of the full-fat ingredients for reduced-fat options. a mac and cheese recipe shared by tiktok user tini in november has gone viral  racking up over 13.2 million likes and 4.1 million saves  and many reviewers say it’s worth the hype.   the dish is made with three tablespoons of butter  three different kinds of cheese  heavy cream  and a pound of pasta  so it’s far from healthy.  however  if you’re thinking about serving this dish at a holiday gathering this year but aren’t thrilled about the amount of fat and calories it contains  health experts say there are ways you can make this recipe healthier with a few simple swaps.  here’s what’s in tiktok’s viral mac and cheese and how you can hack the recipe to improve its nutritional value.   how does tiktok’s viral mac and cheese stack up nutritionally?  ella rauen-prestes  nutritionist and founder of fitbakes  has crunched the numbers and says the recipe’s calorie  fat  and sodium content is alarming.  “one portion has over 1600 calories  which for some people is the full recommended amount of calories you’re supposed to eat in a day ” she says.  “the level of fat is beyond belief ” she adds. “it has 126g  which is double what a person should eat in a day. the saturated fat is almost four times what someone should eat in a whole day.”  additionally  rauen-prestes says the dish’s sodium levels are nearly double the recommended daily allowance.  colin la grange  a weight loss and nutrition expert at medwave  agrees that this recipe is nowhere near healthy.  nevertheless  he says  the viral tiktok recipe uses real ingredients  like real cream  butter  and flour  rather than processed ingredients.  “when compared to a shop-bought  restaurant  or highly-processed ready meal  this may be a better option. when making a meal  using ‘real’ ingredients is a key part of anti-inflammatory weight loss ” he explains.  in addition  la grange says cheese can be a good source of protein  offering 25g per 100g of protein.  “heavy cream does have some nutrients too  including protein  vitamins a and d  and minerals like calcium and phosphorus ” he points out.  on the flip side  la grange points out that this recipe contains zero vegetables and is high in calories.  “heavy cream has 340 calories per 100 grams. it also has a much lower protein content than milk ” he notes.  this means a serving of this mac and cheese dish is unlikely to be satiating.   how to reduce calories  fat  and sodium content in tini’s mac and cheese if you still want to enjoy this tasty mac and cheese recipe  there are several healthy ways you can reduce the calorie  fat  and sodium content you’ll consume with a serving.  rauen-prestes suggests eating a portion of vegetables before eating your mac and cheese.  “the fiber and protein in the vegetables will help your body deal with the fat and refined carbs of the mac and cheese in a much better way ” she explains. “the fiber will also make you feel fuller  so you might eat a smaller portion of the mac and cheese.”  in a similar vein  la grange recommends swapping half your pasta for lightly boiled cauliflower. this will reduce the calorie content  add fiber  and aid satiety.  zucchini is another option. rauen-prestes recommends shredding one and adding it to your dish.  “[zucchinis] don’t taste like anything if added to pasta and cheese  and they will dilute the calories  the fat  and the carbs and improve the fiber level ” she explains. “this is beneficial for our heart  gut health  and glucose levels  reducing future diabetes risk.”   additional healthier swaps you can make another way to cut the calories and fat in this dish is to swap out the full-fat dairy ingredients for reduced-fat dairy options.  la grange recommends swapping out the cream for skimmed milk in the sauce to cut calories significantly.  “whole milk has 82% less calories than heavy cream  and it’s also significantly higher in protein ” he explains. this means you can feel fuller for longer while consuming less calories.  “you can use a lower-fat cheese for the sauce  too ” la grange adds.  butter is another ingredient that ramps up this dish’s calorie and fat content.  “change the butter for olive oil ” rauen-prestes suggests. “it will significantly reduce the saturated fats  which is so damaging for our heart health.”  what about the sodium content? rauen-prestes says it’s a good idea to taste the recipe before adding salt; you might discover that it doesn’t need any extra seasoning.  “if you don’t add salt  or add less than what the recipe says  the level of sodium will be significantly reduced  and your blood pressure will thank you ” she notes.  and if you don’t want to make any significant changes to the recipe? you can create a smaller portion and serve it with a side salad and some protein  la grange recommends.   takeaway  a mac and cheese recipe has gone viral on tiktok with over 13.2 million likes  with many people saying they plan to serve it at holiday gatherings.  however  health experts warn that the recipe is very high in fat  sodium  and calories.  nutritionists say a number of healthy hacks can help improve the dish’s nutritional value  including adding vegetables and swapping some of the full-fat ingredients for reduced-fat options.  ,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tiktoks-viral-mac-and-cheese-healthy-hacks
61,The Pros and Cons of TikTok’s Viral ‘Winter Arc’ Challenge: What to Know,tiktok’s winter arc challenge urges people to work on their health during the winter. the 90-day challenge asks people to choose 10 healthy activities to do every day. these activities address both physical and mental health. experts say the challenge can help people form healthy habits. however  people should be careful that they are following sound health advice. have you ever made a new year’s resolution for yourself  perhaps vowing to finally lose those extra pounds or get into the best shape of your life? about 3 out of 10 people made a new year’s resolution in 2023  according to drive research  so it wouldn’t be surprising if you have made one in the past.  now  however  tiktok users are putting a new spin on things by getting an early start on transforming their lives with the winter arc challenge.  proponents of the winter arc challenge suggest taking 90 days in the late fall and winter to prioritize your physical and mental health rather than waiting for the new year to get a start.  “these are the months where a lot of people tend to slow down … this is the time where people tend to let their foot off the gas ” explains tiktok influencer @carlyupgraded  adding that the winter arc challenge is about “dialing … in and getting super laser focused on your goals.”   according to fortune well  the winter arc challenge features a hardcore mindset reminiscent of another viral tiktok trend called the 75 hard challenge.  they additionally write that it does not have a set plan. instead  people generally come up with a list of 10 self-improvement activities that they’d like to add to their daily routine  such as walking 10 000 steps  drinking more water  or journaling every day.  the activities chosen are meant to boost both physical and mental wellness.  however  experts point out that there could be both pros and cons to following this challenge. we contacted two of them to get their opinions about the winter arc challenge’s potential benefits and risks.  the pros of tiktok’s winter arc challenge jonathan kaplan  m.d. — who is a board-certified plastic surgeon  tech innovator  tiktok influencer  glp-1 expert  and entrepreneur as well as the founder and ceo of buildmyhealth — said he sees “a lot of potential” in this viral tiktok trend.  “from my point of view  there are some real benefits to the 90-day personal development framework ” he said.  kaplan noted firstly that it makes use of a “key psychological window” between november and january when people are already thinking about bettering themselves.  “creating a community-driven  structured challenge is more likely to keep people accountable and moving ” he stated.  another pro of the winter arc challenge is that it leverages what research has shown about how long it takes to form a new habit. kaplan pointed to a 2009 studytrusted source published in the european journal of social psychology which found that  on average  it took people about 66 days to turn a regular practice into a habit.  “[s]o psychologically  a 90-day commitment gives us enough time to form a real habit ” he said.  additionally  since the challenge focuses simultaneously on physical and mental health  kaplan said it addresses the interdependence of wellness  a focus that he uses in his own medical practice.  “the social media piece — which will probably involve tiktok documentation and community support — provides an additional layer of motivation by way of shared experience and  perhaps  social reinforcement ” he concluded.  the cons of the tiktok’s winter arc challenge however  joseph trunzo  ph.d. — who is a licensed  practicing clinical psychologist with expertise in the psychological management of chronic medical illnesses and the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders as well as the associate director of the school of health & behavioral sciences and a professor of psychology at bryant university — urged caution with challenges such as the winter arc challenge.  “broad-based health advice delivered through social media channels (or any media for that matter) that are not tailored to the individual’s physiological and psychological needs can be ineffective or  at worst  directly harmful ” he said.  trunzo further discussed the risks associated with misinterpreting advice  taking that advice to an extreme  or doing something inadvertently harmful.  “while the advice itself may be generally helpful  the application of the advice by the individual – which will encompass all of their psychological  social  and behavioral influences – may not be so beneficial ” he noted.  trunzo added that the best idea is to work with professionals — such as your doctor  therapist  or trainer — to ensure that you are working toward your goals in a healthy  effective way.  if you don’t have access to professionals  he advises looking for information from reputable sources and organizations.  “working on your goals with others can add a positive social aspect as well ” he suggested.  finally  trunzo explained that  while getting healthy can be hard  it should never feel bad.  “[e]xcessively negative thinking  feelings of guilt  isolation  consistently negative comparisons of self to others  or anything else that feels burdensome are all signs that the plan should be re-evaluated ” he said.  takeaway tiktok’s winter arc challenge encourages people to get a headstart on improving their physical and mental health during the late fall and winter rather than waiting to make a new year’s resolution.  the 90-day challenge generally involves making a list of 10 health and wellness-promoting activities to be done every day.  experts say this challenge can be beneficial in helping people form better habits.  however  they should be cautious and make sure that they are seeking out sound advice from professionals.,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tiktok-winter-arc-challenge

63,Daily Walks Could Help You Live Over a Decade Longer,a new study says that regular walking could help you live longer. those who were most active moved the equivalent of 160 minutes of walking per day. people who are not very active could gain as much as 11 years of life by walking more. walking increases life span by improving cardiometabolic health. it’s important to start slow and build up to your walking goal. according to a study published online on november 14  2024  in the british journal of sports medicine  getting less physical activity is linked with premature death.  however  the researchers found that increasing physical activity — for example  taking daily walks — could extend how long people live.  if people were as active as the top one-quarter of americans  they could live around 5 years longer.  additionally  if people who are among the least active brought their activity up to this level  they might add an additional 11 years to their lives.  the authors further speculated that infrastructure changes like walkable neighborhoods and green spaces  which help promote activities like biking and walking  could lead to greater longevity within the general population.   greater physical activity linked to living longer to conduct their study  the researchers gathered data from people older than age 40  which was collected via activity trackers for the 2003-2006 national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes).  they also used 2019 u.s. census data as well as 2017 death data gleaned from the national center for health statistics.  the team then created a mathematical model to predict how different levels of physical activity could influence how long people lived.  they found that the 25% of individuals who were most active engaged in activity levels equivalent to walking 160 minutes every day at a pace of 3 mph.  based on this  they estimated that if all people boosted their activity to this level  they could increase their life expectancy from 78.6 to 84 years — an increase of over 5 years.  however  being in the lowest 25% of activity was associated with a decrease in life expectancy of around 6 years.  if these less active individuals logged an additional 111 minutes of walking each day  though  they could conceivably experience even greater benefits  living nearly 11 years longer.   how walking might increase longevity john lowe  md  a physician at restore care specializing in preventive health and lifestyle medicine  who was not involved in the study  explained that regular walking has several beneficial effects that contribute to a longer life.  it can help you decrease your resting heart rate  manage cholesterol  and reduce your chances of heart attack or stroke.  “walking … can be useful for glucose metabolism ” he added  “because [it is] known to enhance insulin actions  which would enable better blood sugar management and reduce the chances of type 2 diabetes. a walk after meals is particularly effective for blood glucose control.”  regular walking can also protect the body from systemic inflammation  according to lowe. systemic inflammation has been associated with several chronic diseases in epidemiological studies.  “maintaining a walking routine helps downregulate inflammatory markers  including c-reactive protein (crp)  which helps improve immune system responsiveness and maintain cellular health ” he concluded.   how to get started walking more daily steps dr. sean ormond  a pain management doctor with atlas pain specialists  who was also not a part of the study  said that walking doesn’t have to take a large commitment to make a difference for you.  “start with small  doable changes that fit into your daily life ” he said. “for example  instead of finding the closest parking spot  park farther away and enjoy the walk. swap the elevator for the stairs when you can. take five- or ten-minute walking breaks during your workday — maybe a quick lap around your house  office  or even your yard.”  ormond added that taking a gentle walk after meals can be beneficial because it helps you digest your food and doesn’t feel like exercise.  “if you have kids or pets  make walking a family affair ” he suggested. “[i]t’s a great way to bond while staying active.”  if you’d like to take a more structured approach  ormond said step-counting apps and fitness trackers can make walking more fun. “set small  realistic goals  like an extra 500 steps a day  and build from there ” he said.  also  he said that people shouldn’t become discouraged if the 160 minutes of activity mentioned in the study seems like a daunting goal.  “every step you take is a step toward better health ” said ormond. “what matters most is consistency.”  “so  lace up your shoes and see where a walk can take you — physically  mentally  and emotionally. it’s one of the easiest ways to nurture your body and mind for years to come ” he said.  related videos   watch more takeaway a new

64,Protein Diet Coke: Why the ‘Dirty Soda’ Is Taking Over TikTok,protein diet coke has been gaining popularity on social media platforms like tiktok. the drink is typically made by mixing a diet soft drink with a flavored protein shake. health experts say the trendy beverage can help people who are searching for ways to increase their daily protein intake  but adding diet coke to a protein shake does not add nutritional value. instead  experts recommend focusing on a balanced diet that includes natural high protein foods  especially for those who are increasing their daily protein to aid with weight loss. protein diet coke is the latest viral drink trend that’s taken over tiktok.  the beverage isn’t an official product of the coca-cola company  but rather — as its name suggests — a combination of vanilla protein shake and diet coke.  rebecca gordan  an elementary school teacher from utah  helped popularize the drink after a video she posted of herself enjoying a cup of the bubbly brew quickly went viral on tiktok.   since then  videos of people trying the beverage and sharing their twists on the recipe have racked up millions of views on social media platforms  with many singing the drink’s praises as a delicious way of meeting their daily protein goals.  but is this trendy beverage really a “healthy” way of getting more protein in your diet?  healthline spoke with nutritionists to help break down the pros and cons of protein diet coke and reveal whether the viral soda is really worth a sip or one you should skip.   what is protein diet coke? protein diet coke is an offshoot of the “dirty soda” trend  which exploded in popularity in 2022.  a “dirty soda” typically consists of a base soft drink with added flavored syrups  creams  or fruit juices — such as “pilk” (pepsi + milk) — similar to a root beer float or an alcohol-free mocktail.  protein diet coke most often includes two simple ingredients: your choice of diet soft drink mixed with a bottle of ready-made protein shake.   is protein diet coke healthy? “i wouldn’t label protein diet coke as a healthy drink  but i don’t think that it’s unhealthy either ” said destini moody  a certified registered dietitian with top nutrition coaching.  “i do find it a bit odd that we are mixing ready-to-drink protein in soda when we could just…drink the protein. the soda really doesn’t add anything of value considering it doesn’t have any calories and certainly doesn’t contain any additional protein or micronutrients.”  however  moody noted that adding more protein to your diet in the form of whey protein shakes can pack a nutritious punch  especially if you’re trying to increase your daily protein intake.  she personally favors the fairlife core power protein shakes  which are frequently used as a primary ingredient in many #proteindeitcoke videos posted on tiktok.  “they provide a good amount of high quality protein with all of the essential amino acids  half of your daily requirement of calcium  and can certainly go a long way in helping you stay full between meals ” said moody.   can protein diet coke help you lose weight? the dietary guidelines for americans 2020–2025trusted source suggest that adult males should eat at least 56 grams of protein daily  while adult females should eat at least 46 grams daily.  researchtrusted source suggests  however  that eating higher amounts of protein may help you lose weight weight while retaining and building muscle mass.  protein can help increasetrusted source the body’s production of hormones such as glp-1 and pyy  which can help you feel fuller longer.  protein can also help reduce ghrelin (the “hunger hormone”).  moody said that  when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise  protein diet coke may help aid with weight loss when consumed in moderation.  “adding more protein to the diet in the form of whey protein shakes is always an excellent way to both build muscle and lose weight  so if mixing it with [diet] coke encourages more protein intake  i totally co-sign ” moody said.  “drinking this beverage between meals to curb cravings can help you lose weight compared to eating high calorie  carb-based snacks like chips and granola bars that leave you feeling hungry again shortly after you eat them.”  however  she stressed that it’s better to simply “drink the protein shake” without adding the additional soda.  “the diet coke does not add any additional benefit for either building muscle or weight loss. i’d label it as more of a flavor enhancer if anything ” she said.   healthier ways of increasing your daily protein intake while drinking beverages like protein diet coke in moderation may help you beef up your daily protein intake  michelle routhenstein  a preventive cardiology dietitian and heart health expert at entirely nourished  said focusing on an overall healthy diet should be a higher priority.  “for sustainable muscle growth  weight loss  and overall health  it’s better to focus on a balanced meal post-exercise that ensures nutrient adequacy. this approach is more effective because it provides consistent  long-term results and fuels the body appropriately for optimal recovery ” she said.  she also noted that relying on protein shakes as meal replacements “could lead to nutritional gaps  hinder proper recovery post-workout  and potentially contribute to increased oxidative stress  which can impair muscle repair and overall recovery.”  instead  she recommended increasing your protein intake by including more whole foods in your diet  such as:  lean meats fish eggs dairy legumes nuts seeds rather than drinking a protein diet coke for a protein-rich snack  routhenstein recommends trying healthier options like greek yogurt  hard-boiled eggs  or edamame to meet your daily protein needs.  however  if you plan to incorporate protein shakes into your diet  moody suggests beefing them up with healthier natural ingredients.  “i love to take strawberry core power shakes and blend it with frozen strawberries  bananas  greek yogurt (for even more protein) and chia seeds ” moody said.  “in this example  you are getting fiber  antioxidants  omega-3 fatty acids  and more micronutrients like calcium and vitamin c along with the protein. you get none of that with diet coke.”   takeaway protein diet coke has been gaining popularity on social media platforms like tiktok.  the drink is made by mixing a diet soft drink with a flavored protein shake.  health experts say the trendy beverage can help people who are searching for ways to increase their daily protein intake  but adding diet coke to a protein shake does not add nutritional value.  instead  focusing on a balanced diet that includes natural high protein foods is recommen,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/protein-diet-coke
65,Vitamin D Supplements Lower Blood Pressure in Older Adults with Obesity  Study Finds,a new study found that taking vitamin d supplements was associated with lower blood pressure. people with obesity and high blood pressure got the best results. better calcium regulation may be one of the main reasons for this effect. before supplementing with vitamin d  people should get their levels tested. according to new research published on november 12  2024  in the journal of the endocrine society  supplementation with vitamin d plus calcium may help lower blood pressure in older adults with obesity (body mass index (bmi) greater than 30).  these supplements appeared to decrease both systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number).  however  they noted that more is not necessarily better when it comes to lowering blood pressure. the effect was independent of the dose administered.  the people who took part in the study had high blood pressure.  the american heart associationtrusted source states that normal blood pressure is less than 120/80.  anything greater than a systolic blood pressure of 130 or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 is deemed to be high blood pressure.   vitamin d supplements linked with reduced blood pressure the study included 221 individuals ages 65 and older who were taking vitamin d supplements.  they were all classified as having overweight (bmi greater than 25).  additionally  they had a serum 25-hydroxy vitamin d level between 10 and 30 ng/ml. anything below 30 ng/ml is considered insufficient  while values less than 20 are classified as vitamin d deficiency.  two doses were examined: 600 iu/day (the institutes of medicine’s (iom) recommended daily dose) and 3 750 iu/day. both groups also took 250 mg of calcium citrate.  the study participants were followed for one year.  upon comparing the two groups  they found that the higher dose of vitamin d did not provide greater benefit than the lower one.  however  both groups experienced a statistically significant drop in blood pressure  with their systolic blood pressure dropping by 3.5 mm hg and their diastolic blood pressure dropping by 2.8 mm hg.  the research further found that people with obesity and low vitamin d status improved their blood pressure the most.  why vitamin d might affect blood pressure reimas geiga  md  a medical doctor  registered dietitian  and clinical nutritionist with glowbar ldn  explained that vitamin d can affect blood pressure in several ways.  “one of the primary ways is by aiding in calcium regulation ” he said  “which is crucial for the contraction and relaxation of blood vessels. by improving vascular function  vitamin d could help reduce blood pressure.”  additionally  in those with obesity  there is chronic  low-grade inflammation  said geiga. this can impair blood vessel health  contributing to high blood pressure.  “vitamin d has known anti-inflammatory properties that may help counteract this effect ” he explained. “moreover  people with obesity are more likely to experience vitamin d deficiency because fat cells can storetrusted source vitamin d  reducing its availability to the body.”  according to geiga  supplementation back to adequate levels can help improve vascular health and lower blood pressure.  “additionally  vitamin d influences the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  a key regulator of blood pressure ” he said. “adequate vitamin d levels may reduce the activity of this system  leading to better blood pressure control.”  are vitamin d supplements right for you? given that vitamin d is easy to obtain  patients may wonder how they can apply the study’s findings to their own lives.  dr. rita hawle  a clinical dietitian and nutritionist with clinicspots  says the first step is determining whether you are actually low in vitamin d.  “a simple blood test can reveal any deficiency that may be contributing to blood pressure issues ” she said. “if levels are low  supplements or a bit of natural sunlight exposure (when safe) can help improve vitamin d status over time.”  however  she added that vitamin d supplementation really needs to be a part of a larger strategy.  “blood pressure responds well to a combined approach—regular exercise  a heart-healthy diet  and effective weight management are all important for long-term benefits ” said hawle.  additionally  while the study looked at supplementation with 600 iu and 3 750 iu doses  she advises speaking with your physician about what is an appropriate dose for you.  vitamin d can accumulatetrusted source in the human body  leading to a toxic build-up of calcium.  “this study provides encouraging insights ” hawle concluded  “but it’s best to view vitamin d as part of a larger wellness plan  particularly for individuals managing both obesity and high blood pressure.”  takeaway a new study reports that older people with high blood pressure who were taking a vitamin d supplement along with calcium had lower blood pressure after a year.  the best results were experienced by people with obesity and lower initial levels of vitamin d at the start of the study.  improved calcium regulation  lower inflammation  and reduced activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system could account for the reduction in blood pressure.  experts recommend getting a blood test to determine if you are actually low in vitamin d and following your doctor’s advice regarding the dose you take before supplementing with it.  supplementation should be part of a combined approach that includes a healthy diet  exercise  and weight management.  ,Health,https://healthline.com/health-news/vitamin-d-supplements-lower-blood-pressure
66,An Extra 5 Minutes of Vigorous Exercise Per Day Could Help Lower Blood Pressure,new research shows adding a few minutes of vigorous “everyday” physical activity to your daily exercise routine could help control blood pressure. heart-pumping activities like cycling  running  and stair climbing were linked to lower blood pressure readings among study participants. an extra 5 minutes of exercise led to mild improvements in blood pressure  with clinically meaningful results at an additional 10 and 20 minutes of physical activity. experts recommend aiming for 30 minutes of aerobic exercise daily to control blood pressure and maintain a healthy heart. exercise is universally linked with positive outcomes  like maintaining healthy blood pressure.  short bursts of physical activity can help get your heart pumping  but regular exercise is key for overall health.  a new study published november 6 in the journal circulation suggests that adding a few minutes of vigorous physical activity to your daily exercise routine can help lower blood pressure.  the researchers found that an extra 5 minutes of stair climbing  cycling  and running was linked to slight reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure  while clinically meaningful improvements were seen at an additional 10 and 20 minutes of daily exercise.  less strenuous forms of movement  such as standing or walking  had minimal effects on blood pressure.  “our findings suggest that  for most people  exercise is key to reducing blood pressure ” first author jo blodgett  phd  a senior research fellow at ucl surgery & interventional science and the institute of sport  exercise & health  said in a statement.  “the good news is that whatever your physical ability  it doesn’t take long to have a positive effect on blood pressure. but if you want to change your blood pressure  putting more demand on the cardiovascular system through exercise will have the greatest effect ” blodgett continued.   everyday activities help control hypertension researchers from university college london and the university of sydney conducted this study with support from the british heart foundation (bhf).  the research team analyzed health data and blood pressure measurements from 14 761 participants with an average age of 54 from six cohorts in the prospective physical activity  sitting  and sleep consortium (propass).  they tracked blood pressure changes over 24-hour periods comprising six different activities with the following average durations:  sleeping — 7.1 hours sedentary behavior (i.e.  sitting) — 10.7 hours slow walking (fewer than 100 steps per minute) — 1.6 hours fast walking (more than 100 steps per minute) — 1.1 hours standing — 3.2 hours exercise (i.e.  running  cycling) — 16 minutes they estimated the impact of replacing one type of activity with an additional 5  10  and 20 minutes of exercise.  they found that replacing less active behaviors with 5 minutes of exercise lowered systolic blood pressure (sbp) by 0.68 millimeters of mercury (mmhg) and diastolic blood pressure (dbp) by 0.54 mmhg.  they note that a 2mmhg reduction in sbp and a 1mmhg reduction in dpb equates to a 10% reduction in heart disease risk.  they also estimate that 20 additional minutes of daily exercise could lead to clinically meaningful improvements in sbp  and 10 extra minutes of exercise per day could improve dbp.  the researchers emphasize that everyday activities that get the heart pumping may promote healthy blood pressure.  “what’s unique about our exercise variable is that it includes all exercise-like activities  from climbing the stairs to a short cycling errand  many of which can be integrated into daily routines. for those who don’t do a lot of exercise  walking did still have some positive benefits for blood pressure ” blodgett continued.   exercise lowers blood pressure  benefits heart health cheng-han chen  md  board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the structural heart program at memorialcare saddleback medical center in laguna hills  ca  told healthline the study reinforces physician-backed recommendations for regular daily exercise.  “it is encouraging to see measurable changes in blood pressure with just a few minutes of exercise  something that can be incorporated into even a busy schedule ” chen said.  “we know that physical activity directs our organs and tissue to undergo changes that improve their performance and efficiency  which can then lead to improved blood pressure control. by increasing the intensity of exercise  you are accelerating the physiological changes that are providing the benefits to heart health ” he explained.   how much physical activity do you need? the findings of this study do not suggest that 5 minutes of exercise a day is enough but rather encourage people already getting regular exercise to increase their output  particularly those with high blood pressure.  current cdc guidelinestrusted source for physical activity recommend 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week for adults  75 minutes of vigorous exercise  or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise.  for heart health  chen said he typically recommends 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity daily on most days of the week.  to effectively lower blood pressure  chen echoed the findings from this study and recommended aerobic forms of exercise  such as:  walking jogging cycling swimming or water aerobics “it is also helpful to incorporate some strength training  as this also helps to improve the function of blood vessels and improve blood pressure ” chen said.  “patients who do not have their blood pressure under control should avoid very high intensity exercises such as sprinting or heavy weights  as these activities can lead to a spike in blood pressure ” he advised.   other ways to lower blood pressure  chen noted that many people may not realize the health benefits of adding a little exercise to their daily routine.  “there are many easy ways to incorporate physical activity throughout the course of the day ” he noted. some examples may include:  short 5-minute brisk walks while at work taking the stairs instead of the elevator parking farther from the store and walking chen noted that if you live with high blood pressure  you should talk with your doctor about lifestyle factors that can help control it.  regular physical activity aside  other ways to lower blood pressure may include:  following a healthy  balanced diet low in sodiumtrusted source getting enough quality sleep maintaining a healthy weighttrusted source avoiding tobacco and alcohol managing stress  takeaway a new study showed improvements in blood pressure with an additional 5 minutes of daily exercise. the findings became more significant with an extra 10 and 20 minutes of heart-pumping physical activity each day.  aim for around 30 minutes of aerobic daily exercise to control blood pressure and maintain a healthy heart. if you have high blood pressure or live with another chronic health condition  check with your doctor before starting a new exercise routine.  ,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/extra-5-minutes-daily-exercise-lower-blood-pressure-hypertension
67,Poor Sleep In Your 40s Linked to Faster Brain Aging Later In Life,a new study reports that people in their 40s who have difficulty sleeping have a brain age 1.6 to 2.6 years older by the time they’re in their 50s compared to people who consistently get quality sleep. experts say quality sleep can improve brain health and lower dementia risk and also decrease inflammation in the body and boost the immune system. you can promote a good night’s sleep by exercising during the day  putting away electronic devices before bedtime  going to sleep around the same time every night  and sleeping in a cool  darkened room. poor sleep quality in your 40s can affect your brain health later in life.  that’s the conclusion of a study published on october 23 in neurology  the journal of the american academy of neurology.  in their findings  researchers from the university of california san francisco (ucsf) and other institutions reported that people who have poor sleep quality around the age of 40 can have a brain age from 1.6 years to 2.6 years older than people who regularly get quality sleep.  “our findings highlight the importance of addressing sleep problems earlier in life to preserve brain health  including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule  exercising  avoiding caffeine and alcohol before going to bed and using relaxation techniques ” kristine yaffe  md  a study author and professor of psychiatry at ucsf as well as a member of the american academy of neurology  said in a news release.  “future research should focus on finding new ways to improve sleep quality and investigating the long-term impact of sleep on brain health in younger people ” yaffe continued.   examining the link between sleep and brain health in their study  researchers looked at 589 people with a mean age of 40. about 53% of participants were female and 39% were black.  at the start of the research  participants were asked to fill out a survey with questions such as:  do you usually have trouble falling asleep? do you usually wake up several times at night? do you usually wake up far too early? the researchers recorded the number of six poor sleep characteristics reported by each individual. the sleep habits included:  short sleep duration bad sleep quality difficulty falling asleep difficulty staying asleep early morning awakening daytime sleepiness based on the responses  the researchers assigned participants into three groups:  0-1 poor sleep characteristics 2-3 poor sleep characteristics more than 3 poor sleep characteristics at this initial phase  70% of participants had no more than one poor sleep habit. another 22% had 2 to 3 characteristics while 8% had more than 3 characteristics.  the researchers then sent the same survey to participants 5 years later. after another 10 years  they used mri scans and machine learning tests to estimate the participants’ brain age.  the researchers reported that people with more than 3 poor sleep characteristics had an average brain age of 2.6 years older than people in the group with 1 or less characteristic. people with 2 to 3 characteristics had an average brain age of 1.6 years older than people in the lowest group.  “this study is impactful  since it demonstrates the relationship between poor sleep and accelerated brain aging in middle-aged adults  and offers promise that early treatment to manage sleep problems could prevent neurocognitive dysfunction in the future ” clete kushida  md  a neurologist and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at stanford university in california  told healthline. kushida wasn’t involved in the study.  scott kaiser  md  a geriatrician and the director of geriatric cognitive health for the pacific neuroscience institute at providence saint john’s health center in california  not involved in the study  agreed.  “this is a highly compelling study — finding clear associations between poor sleep quality in midlife and accelerated brain aging — that contributes important insights into a critical body of research investigating connections between sleep and brain health.” kaiser told healthline.   quality sleep is crucial for brain health the researchers acknowledged a limitation of their study was the self-reporting by participants of their sleep habits. they also said the study was observational so it only produced an association between poor sleep and brain aging instead of a causation.  nonetheless  the researchers said their findings emphasize the importance of quality sleep. experts agreed.  “sleep is without question important to brain health ” kushida told healthline. “we know that some sleep disorders  such as obstructive sleep apnea  can have effects on neurocognitive function and risk of cerebrovascular disease. additionally  the relationship of poor sleep with brain aging is an important one as shown in the study.”  “there is an increasingly robust body of research demonstrating the critical importance of a good night’s sleep for brain health ” kaiser said.  “whether through the clearing of debris  ‘resetting’ of neural networks  or providing down-time to various systems  the quantity and quality of sleep [although in this particular study the accelerated brain aging findings were limited to those with poor sleep quality] have profound physiologic impacts that impact our day to day thinking  memory  and mood as well as our long-term risk of cognitive decline and dementia ” kaiser noted.   quality sleep essential for overall health sleep is now listed among the top lifestyle factors for maintaining good health.  researchers have reported that quality sleep can:  maintain critical body functions restore energy repair muscle tissue allow the brain to process new information past research has indicated that consistent quality sleep can lower a person’s risk of dementia.  other research has concluded that quality sleep can also help a person lose or maintain weight  strengthen the heart  lower type 2 diabetes risk  boost the immune system  and decrease inflammation in the body.  experts say it’s important to have good sleep hygiene at any age.  “sleep is important in all ages ” kushida said. “we know that in children and adolescents  sleep problems can lead to delayed growth and behavioral issues. middle age is when many sleep disorders and medical disorders that impact sleep become more prevalent and increase further with age  and as demonstrated in this study  poor sleep in this age group is associated with advanced brain age ” he added.

certain ages:  infants 4 to 12 months old: 12-16 hours (including naps) toddlers 1-2 years old: 11-14 hours (including naps) preschoolers 3-5 years old: 10-13 hours (including naps) school-age children 6-12 years old: 9-12 hours teenagers 13 to 18 years old: 8-10 hours adults: 7 hours or more getting a consistent amount of sleep isn’t always easy. the cdc offers tips to achieve quality sleep:  spend time in bright light during the daytime exercise regularly  aiming for 30 minutes per day five days a week eat meals at consistent times avoid heavy meals  nicotine  caffeine  and alcohol before bedtime use a consistent routine to wind down at night put away electronic devices an hour before bedtime and sleep in a quiet  cool  and dark environment kushida added a few more items to this list.  go to sleep and wake up at approximately the same time every day. avoid irregular long daytime naps. avoid staying in bed longer than 20 minutes if you can’t go to sleep or can’t fall back asleep after awaking in the middle of the night. kaiser urged anyone with sleep difficulties to seek professional guidance.  “there are healthcare professionals with expertise in this domain who can further evaluate your issues and may offer effective solutions to improve sleep quality  including addressing the specific poor sleep characteristics —difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep  early morning awakening  and daytime sleepiness — assessed in this study and associated with accelerated brain aging ” kaiser said.   takeaway poor sleeping habits during your 40s may affect brain health in later years.  in a new study  researchers reported that a group of people with a mean age of 40 who experienced poor sleep hygiene showed brain ages 1.6 years to 2.6 years older than people the same age who practiced healthy sleep patterns.  experts say quality sleep provides a number of health benefits from repairing muscle tissue to allowing the brain to process new information to lowering the risk of inflammation  and boosting the immune system.  they say you can improve your chances of getting a good night’s sleep by going to bed approximately the same time every night

68,80% of Strokes Are Preventable. Here's How to Reduce Your Risk,the american stroke association has updated its guidelines on stroke risk reduction for the first time since 2014. in their recommendations  the asa urges healthcare professionals to carefully screen patients for risk factors such as high blood pressure  elevated cholesterol levels  obesity  and high blood sugar. the new stroke guidelines highlight unique risk factors for females and transgender women and how social determinants of health impact stroke risk. the guidelines also emphasize the benefits of glp-1 drugs for cardiovascular health  and encourage a balanced diet  regular physical activity  maintaining a healthy weight  and getting adequate sleep. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) estimatestrusted source nearly 800 000 people have a stroke every year in the united states. of these  more than 600 000 will be a first-time stroke.  for the first time in 10 years  the american stroke association (asa) has updated its guidelines for reducing stroke risk. according to an asa news releasetrusted source  up to 80% of strokes may be preventable through diet and lifestyle changes and other modifications.  the 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroketrusted source also urges healthcare professionals to carefully screen individuals for stroke risk factors  including:  high blood pressure elevated cholesterol levels high blood sugar obesity many of the new stroke guidelines coincide with the american heart association’s life’s essential 8trusted source  which promotes cardiovascular and brain health. the lifestyle factors in the asa’s new stroke guidelines include a healthy diet  regular exercise  better sleep  and smoking cessation.  “patients looking to reduce their stroke risk (and cardiovascular disease risk in general) should strive to follow the american heart association’s essential 8 recommendations for healthy living ” said cheng-han chen  md  an interventional cardiologist and medical director of the structural heart program at memorialcare saddleback medical center in california. chen wasn’t involved in the new guidelines.  “we recommend that people eat a healthy balanced diet  engage in regular physical activity  get an adequate amount of sleep  maintain a healthy weight  avoid tobacco and alcohol  reduce stress  and control their blood pressure and cholesterol numbers ” chen told healthline.  overall  the guidelines provide a clear pathway for medical professionals and their patients. the guidelines also call for more public awareness and education about how people can lower their risk of stroke.   women face unique stroke risk factors the updated stroke guidelines recommend that medical professionals screen for conditions that can increase the risk of stroke in females.  stroke risk factors affecting females include the use of oral hormonal contraceptives  developing high blood pressure during pregnancy  and pregnancy complications  such as:  premature birth endometriosis premature ovarian failure early-onset menopause the guidelines also note that transgender women and gender-diverse individuals taking estrogen may also be at an increased risk of stroke.   social determinants of health and stroke risk the new stroke recommendations emphasizetrusted source “social drivers of health.” these non-medical factors include inequities in healthcare  education  economic stability  and structural racism.  the asa adds that neighborhood factors such as a lack of walkability and access to healthy food also play a role. the guidelines urge medical professionals to advocate for patients in these circumstances.  “some populations have an elevated risk of stroke  whether it be due to genetics  lifestyle  biological factors and/or social determinants of health  and in some cases  people do not receive appropriate screening to identify their risk ” said cheryl bushnell  md  a professor and vice chair of research in the department of neurology at wake forest university school of medicine in north carolina  in a news releasetrusted source. bushnell is chair of the group that wrote the new guidelines.  “this guideline is important because new discoveries have been made since the last update 10 years ago ” she continued. “understanding which people are at increased risk of a first stroke and providing support to preserve heart and brain health can help prevent a first stroke.”  josé morales  md  a vascular neurologist and neurointerventional surgeon at providence saint john’s health center in california morales echoed the importance of primary stroke prevention and said the guidelines were long overdue. morales wasn’t involved in developing the new guidelines.  “the focus on equitable access to healthcare  social determinants of health  and gender-specific recommendations are important additions to guiding clinical practice in an evidence-driven matter ” he told healthline.   glp-1 drugs may reduce stroke risk the asa’s guidelines include a new recommendation for healthcare professionals to consider prescribing glp-1 weight loss drugs  such as ozempic  mounjaro  zepbound  and wegovy.  the medications  which have been approved by federal regulators as treatments for obesity or type 2 diabetes  have shown promise in clinical trials in improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of stroke.  chen said the inclusion of newer topics such as weight-loss drugs into the new guidelines is an important step.  “these updated guidelines also incorporate the important new class of drug (glp-1 agonists) that we are finding to be extremely effective in treating those same risk factors for stroke ” chen noted.   healthy diet for stroke prevention one of the most important things you can do to prevent a stroke is to maintain a healthy  balanced diet.  the new guidelines urge people to stick closely to a mediterranean diet. this diet focuses on the eating habits of people who live along the mediterranean sea.  that plan encourages people to consume more fruits and vegetables as well as legumes  nuts  seeds  and heart-healthy fats. it discourages the consumption of processed foods  added sugars  refined grains. it also recommends limiting the consumption of alcohol.  “risk factors for stroke vary by age  gender  genetics  comorbidities  and even medications. therefore  i think the suggestion of screening for not only the basic risk factors but also secondary factors is essential to prescribe the right lifestyle interventions ” said kristin kirkpatrick  ms rdn  a dietitian at the cleveland clinic department of wellness & preventive medicine in ohio. kirkpatrick wasn’t involved in the new guidelines.  “for my patients  i will often also recommend a mediterranean pattern  but then work with the patient to assess tweaks to that pattern ” she told healthline.  “for example  with someone who has insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes  i may focus on a more moderate carbohydrate version of the med diet. for patients with high blood pressure  i may counsel more on a low sodium perspective. the most important component  however  may be to focus as a whole on a more plant-forward approach that limits ultra-processed foods  sugar  refined grains  and excess amounts of alcohol ” kirkpatrick continued.  “i also recommend nutrigenomics testing for my patients as well to be able to get a truly personalized approach to prevention based on genetics ” she said.   exercise and stroke prevention the guidelines recommend that healthcare professionals screen patients for sedentary behavior and counsel them to engage in regular exercise.  as noted by the asa’s news releasetrusted source  physical activity is “essential for stroke risk reduction and overall heart health.”  the cdc recommendstrusted source that adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity. that exercise should be spread throughout the week.  regular exercise can help improve metrics such as blood pressure  cholesterol levels  inflammatory markers  insulin resistance  and overall weight.  “a combination of both aerobic and anaerobic is essential to focus on both muscle retention (and growth) as well as cardiovascular health. flexibility is also an important factor ” kirkpatrick said.  healthline newsletter get our eat well newsletter we've created tasty and nutritious recipes to try the next time you need

arteries that can eventually lead to a higher risk of stroke  heart attack  and other cardiovascular issues.  the typical way to diagnose hypertension is by having your blood pressure checked.  causes of high blood pressure include family history  smoking  and a high intake of caffeine  alcohol  and salt. a lack of physical activity and obesity can also be factors.  in addition to regular screenings  the guidelines urge healthcare professionals to make sure patients at risk for high blood pressure are eating a heathy diet and getting regular exercise.  “over the past decade  we have gained a better appreciation for the need to manage lifestyle-related cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension  overweight/obesity  cholesterol  and blood sugar control ” chen said.  sleep quality and stroke prevention healthy sleep is listed in both the new guidelines and the life’s essential 8 as an important component of reducing stroke risk and promoting heart health.  the cdc estimatestrusted source that more than 30% of u.s. adults get insufficient sleep.  the cdc recommendstrusted source that adults obtain a minimum of 7 hours of sleep per night. it’s also not recommended that you get more than 9 hours of sleep per night.  “adequate and consistent sleep  mindfulness  and taking steps to reduce exposure to pollution would be other factors ” kirkpatrick said.  what to know about stroke stroke is the fifth leading cause of deathtrusted source with nearly 160 000 related deaths annually. the cdc notestrusted source that stroke is also a leading cause of long-term disability.  cdc officials add that stroke-related costs in the u.s. were $56 billion between 2019 and 2020. those costs included healthcare services  medications  and missed days of work.  a stroke occurs when there is a blockage in the blood supply to the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures. the blockage or rupture prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues.  symptoms of a stroke include:  paralysis numbness or weakness in the arm  face  or leg. trouble speaking or understanding others vision problems dizziness sudden headache medical professionals say the quicker someone is diagnosed with a stroke and receives treatment  the better their chances for survival and recovery.  they recommend a person attending to a person who is suspected of having a stroke to adhere to a checking system with the acronym be-fast. that stands for:  balance: does the person have trouble standing? eyes: are they experiencing vision difficulties?

69,Got a Sweet Tooth? Here’s Why Your Risk of Depression  Diabetes  and Stroke May be Higher,in a recent study  having a sweet tooth was linked with a greater risk of depression compared to those who favor healthier foods. preferring sweets was also associated with greater metabolic disease risk. people who strongly prefer sweets had higher inflammation  blood sugar  and lipids. small  sustainable changes will make it easier to reduce your sugar intake. you may even find that you feel better in just a few weeks  giving you an incentive to continue. do you have a sweet tooth? according to statista  many people in the u.s. do. in fact  when they surveyed americans in 2022 and 2023  41% said they ate sweets regularly.  however  if you consume a lot of sugary foods  research indicates that you may want to reconsider your choices.  in the october 2024 studytrusted source  which was published in the journal of translational medicine  the researchers found that people who favored sweets had a higher risk of depression than those who preferred healthier foods.  these individuals also had higher levels of inflammation  blood sugar  and lipids  which can indicate a risk of metabolic disease.  on the other hand  those people who had a more health-conscious eating pattern had reduced risk of heart disease and stroke  per the authors.   how having a sweet tooth affects metabolic disease risk the researchers examined data from blood samples taken from the uk biobank  a large database containing health and genetic information for half a million volunteers in the u.k.  the data contained information about 2 923 proteins and 168 metabolites that had been measured to look for changes.  the research team used unsupervised machine learning to look for patterns in this data  finding three distinct groups based on people’s food preferences: health-conscious (preferring vegetables and fresh fruit to animal-based foods and sweets)  omnivore (preferring all foods)  and sweet-tooth (having a high preference for sweet foods and beverages).  looking at the various proteins and metabolites  they found those in the sweet tooth group had higher c-reactive protein  a marker for inflammation.  they also had higher blood sugar and worse lipids  elevating their risk of metabolic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.  the team further found that having a preference for sweets was linked with a greater likelihood of having depression  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease compared with the other two groups.  on the other hand  the health-conscious group had a reduced risk of heart failure  chronic kidney disease  and stroke; and the omnivore group had only moderate health risks.  while they did not directly observe what people ate  the researchers noted that food preferences alone could potentially be used to predict people’s risk for metabolic diseases.  however  more research is required to confirm their findings.   why having a sweet tooth might increase health risks dr. michael o. mckinney  a physician and nutritionist with healthy outlook  said that the risks to physical and mental health increase when we eat a lot of sugar because of how sugar affects the body’s functioning.  he said that when you consume sugar  your blood sugar rises  which in turn increases the amount of insulin produced to cope with the added sugar.  “the consumption of food items containing excessively high glucose levels in the long course can result in insulin resistance ” said mckinney  “which is a root cause of metabolic illnesses such as type ii diabetes.”  ingesting excess sugar and carbohydrates can also lead to high levels of inflammation  he said  which is linked with heart disease  stroke  and mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.  “inflammation can damage the brain and impair the body’s capacity to govern emotions  increasing mental illness susceptibilities ” explained mckinney.   how you can reduce your sugar consumption dr. ramit singh sambyal  an md/general physician associated with clinicspots  said that reducing your sugar consumption doesn’t have to be overwhelming.  “small  gradual changes can make a huge difference ” he said.  the first step is becoming aware of all the places that sugar can hide.  “many everyday foods  even ones marketed as ‘healthy ’ contain hidden sugars ” said sambyal.  he suggests taking a closer look at labels  especially those of products like sauces  salad dressings  and flavored yogurts.  sambyal also advised learning to look for sugar’s different names  such as glucose or maltose.  another step in reducing your sugar consumption is to reach for whole fruits like apples and berries rather than grabbing a candy bar or other sugary snack.  “they provide natural sweetness while also offering fiber  which helps stabilize blood sugar ” he said.  however  you don’t need to make any drastic changes right away.  “start by making small adjustments — like using less sugar in your coffee or choosing whole grains over sugary cereals ” suggested sambyal. “this makes the change more manageable and sustainable in the long term.”  finally  he advises looking at any sugary drinks that you regularly indulge in. “sodas  fruit juices  and energy drinks are some of the biggest sources of added sugar in our diets ” said sambyal. “switching to water  sparkling water  or herbal tea can make a big difference.”  while cutting out sugar can result in some temporary sugar detox symptoms  you may find that you feel better within just a few short weeks.  in fact  sambyal mentioned that those with depression may experience changes in their well-being relatively quickly.  “patients who reduce their sugar intake often notice improvements in their energy levels and mood ” said sambyal. “they feel less sluggish and experience fewer mood swings.”  and  of course  in the long term  you reduce your risk of not only depression but also conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  “reducing sugar is one of the best steps you can take for your health ” said sambyal. “even small changes can significantly improve your physical and mental well-being over time.”   takeaway according to a new study  having a sweet tooth may be linked with a greater risk for depression.  these people also had higher inflammation  blood sugar  and lipids  which may indicate a greater risk for metabolic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.  to eat less sugar  you can start slowly by reading labels and making better choices  like having whole fruits when you crave sweetness and putting less sugar in your coffee.  small changes will add up over time to a happier  healthier you.,Health,https://www.healthline.com/health-news/sweet-tooth-stroke-diabetes-depression-risk
70,Europe fines Meta $840 million over ‘abusive’ practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace,the european union has fined meta platforms €798 million ($840 million) over what it called abusive practices benefiting facebook marketplace.  “the european commission has fined meta … for breaching eu antitrust rules by tying its online classified ads service facebook marketplace to its personal social network facebook and by imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads service providers ” the eu’s executive arm said in a statement.  meta (meta) said it will appeal the decision  but in the meantime  it will comply and will work quickly and constructively to launch a solution that addresses the points raised.   the move by the european commission comes two years after it accused the us tech giant of giving its classified ads service facebook marketplace an unfair advantage by bundling the two services together.  meta's european headquarters in dublin  ireland  in february 2023. related article meta accused of breaking european law with its ‘pay or consent’ model  the european union opened formal proceedings into possible anticompetitive conduct of facebook in june 2021  and in december 2022 raised concerns that meta ties its dominant social network facebook to its online classified ad services.  facebook launched marketplace in 2016 and expanded into several european countries a year later.   the eu decision argues that meta imposes facebook marketplace on people who use facebook in an illegal “tie” but meta said that argument ignores the fact that facebook users can choose whether to engage with marketplace  and many do not.  meta said the european commission claimed that marketplace had the potential to hinder the growth of large incumbent online marketplaces in the eu but could not find any evidence of harm to competitors.  companies risk fines of as much as 10% of their global turnover for eu antitrust violations.,Technology,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/14/tech/meta-fine-europe-facebook-marketplace-intl/index.html
71,US government’s proposal to boost EV sales is challenging but not impossible,the us government is planning to change auto emissions standards in a way that means automakers would need to sell a lot more electric vehicles. by 2032  electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of all the new cars sold in america.  without these requirements  electric vehicles would have reached that sort of market share sometime after 2035  according to moody’s industry analyst matthias heck. the goals laid out by the epa are manageable  he said  but it won’t be easy and high levels of investment would be needed. for now  the proposal is still just that  a proposal  and could well change before before being finalized  heck pointed out.  over the next decade things will change a lot  including charging infrastructure and the vehicles themselves. consumers will be drawn to electric vehicles more as battery technology improves and prices drop. and government incentives  like those under the new inflation reduction act  will help  too.   01 kia electric suv the big  electric kia ev9 has carpets made out of recycled fishing nets  it’s important to remember that  nearly a decade from now  electric vehicles are going to be different from what’s on the market today  said chris harto a policy analyst for transportation and energy at consumer reports. and even as ev market share rises to two-thirds  it’s not like evs will flood america’s roads overnight  he said. eighty percent of the cars on the roads in 2032 will still be gas-powered  he said  but shopping for a new vehicle will be different.  ‘we’re talking about past cost parity  so it’s going to be the same price or cheaper ” compared to a gas-powered car  he said.  at the same time  driving ranges will increase  fast charging will be easier and more accessible and owners will enjoy greatly reduced operating costs  harto said. moody’s heck predicted that next-generation ev batteries expected in the next few years will go 30% further on a charge and will recharge 30% faster.  future electric vehicles like the chevrolet blazer ev will provide more options for mainstream consumers. future electric vehicles like the chevrolet blazer ev will provide more options for mainstream consumers. general motors so when combined with improved charging networks – something else that can be expected over that time – electric cars won’t be a particularly hard sell for consumers who are just looking for the best vehicle at a good price  harto said.  there will also be more electric vehicle models available by 2032. today  there are “ev equivalents” available for roughly 40% of the gas vehicle models americans can buy  according to elizabeth krear  vice president of the electric vehicle practice at jd power. electric market share now stands at 8.5%.  krear did not specifically comment on the chances of evs making up two-thirds of the us auto market by 2032. but by 2026  just three years from now  krear expects there will be “ev equivalents” for 75% of the vehicles americans shop for and market share will have already tripled to 27%. in california  where evs are more popular and there are more models available  ev market share is already expected to reach the two-thirds mark before 2032.  an employee of the stuttgart-based car manufacturer mercedes-benz works on an internal combustion engine vehicle in factory 56 at the merecdes-benz plant in sindelfingen  germany. in addition to the eqs  all variants of the mercedes-benz s-class and the mercedes-maybach s-class come off the production line at factory 56. eu was set to ban internal combustion engine cars. then germany suddenly changed its mind  california plans to allow the sale of only fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2035  a goal it’s on the way to meeting  according to corey cantor  an analyst with bloomberg nef. so california should be at over 80% market share for plug-in vehicles  including plug-in hybrids  by 2032 and california itself  through its sheer size  is a big factor in the overall us vehicle market.  “california’s influence on the whole country is really bringing it forward to maybe a year sooner than where it would be without california ” he said.  reaching two-thirds ev market share mark by 2032 isn’t a sure thing  said cantor  but it should be manageable.  the increasing number of automakers entering the ev market will also help  said ivan drury  an industry analyst with edmunds.com. many car buyers tend to be very loyal to their preferred vehicle brand.  “not everyone is willing to jump ship just because it’s an ev or it has x-y-z piece of technology ” said drury. ” i think that when you have something like toyota  definitely a loyal consumer base  they don’t want anything other than toyotas.”  currently  toyota offers only one electric model in the united states  the bz4x suv  but more are planned. honda  another japanese brand with a loyal following  offers no evs currently but the company is gearing up factories in ohio to build future ev models. honda expects to offer its first ev next year. general motors also has a number of ev models coming in the next year or two.  peter valdes-dapens took a 950-mile trip in an electric car and found electric cars don't need better batteries  america needs more chargers.  electric cars don't need better batteries. america needs better charging networks  gm  on its own  will provide a good test of the american market’s readiness for evs in the next couple of years  said drury. that automaker  which has pledged to offer nothing but electric passenger vehicles by 2035  will begin selling models in a range of market segments and price points.  the alliance for automotive innovation  an industry group that includes most major automakers operating in the country  posted a statement on its website expressing caution about the goals and asking for cooperation from various government agencies.  “[a] lot has to go right for this massive – and unprecedented – change in our automotive market and industrial base to succeed ” the group wrote in its statement.  at some point  various automakers that may have been slower than gm to embrace electric will simply have to make the switch for economic reasons  said cantor. once consumers start broadly embracing evs  continuing to invest in the development and production of internal combustion vehicles just won’t make economic sense any longer.,Technology,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/12/business/electric-car-regulations-response/index.html
72,How to protect yourself from iPhone thieves locking you out of your own device,a complex but concerning method of gaining control over a user’s iphone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise.  some iphone thieves are exploiting a security setting  called the recovery key  that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos  messages  data and more  according to a recent wall street journal report. some victims also told the publication their bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps.  it’s important to note  however  this type of takeover is hard to pull off. it requires a criminal essentially watching an iphone user enter the device’s passcode – for example  by looking over their shoulder at a bar or sporting event – or manipulating the device’s owner so they’ll share their passcode. and that’s all before they physically steal the device.   from there  a thief could use the passcode to change the device’s apple id  turn off “find my iphone” so their location can’t be tracked  and then reset the recovery key  a complex 28-digit code intended to protect its owners from online hackers.  apple requires this key to help reset or regain access to an apple id in an effort to bolster the user’s security  but if a thief changes it  the original owner will not have the new code and will be locked out of the account.  “we sympathize with people who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously  no matter how rare ” an apple spokesperson said in a statement to cnn. “we work tirelessly every day to protect our users’ accounts and data  and are always investigating additional protections against emerging threats like this one.”  on its website  apple warns “you’re responsible for maintaining access to your trusted devices and your recovery key. if you lose both of these items  you could be locked out of your account permanently.”  jeff pollard  vp and principal analyst at forrester research  said the company should offer more customer support options and “ways for apple users to authenticate so they can reset these settings.”  for now  however  there are a handful of steps users can take to potentially protect themselves from having this happen to them.  protect the passcode the first step is protecting the passcode.  an apple spokesperson told cnn people can use face id or touch id when unlocking their phone in public to avoid revealing their passcode to anyone who might be watching.  users can also set up a longer  alphanumeric passcode that’s harder for bad actors to figure out. device owners should also change the passcode immediately if they believe someone else has seen it.  screen time settings another step someone could consider is a hack not necessarily endorsed by apple but one that’s been circulating online. within an iphone’s screen time setting  which allows guardians to set up restrictions on how kids can use the device  there is the option to set up a secondary password that would be required from any user before they could successfully change an apple id.  by enabling this  a thief would be prompted for that secondary password before changing an apple id password.  back up phone regularly finally  users can protect themselves by regularly backing up an iphone – via icloud or itunes – so data can be recovered in the case an iphone is stolen. at the same time  users may want to consider storing important photos or other sensitive files and data in another cloud service  such as google photos  microsoft onedrive  amazon photos or dropbox.  this won’t stop a bad actor from gaining access to the device  but it should limit some of the fallout if it ever should happen.,Technology,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/23/tech/iphone-thief-recovery-key/index.html
73,Multifamily Residences Turn to Tech for Tenant Appeal  Efficiency: Report,fast  secure  reliable connectivity is now an expectation at multifamily residences  according to a report released monday by market research and consulting company parks associates and xfinity communities.  residents need access to high-speed internet services to work  attend class  and stream video and games  among other high-bandwidth activities  it explained  while properties need connectivity solutions that help them better manage operations  bring down costs  and reduce risk in an age of skyrocketing insurance costs.  “by embracing connectivity  iot  and wireless technologies  property owners can not only improve their operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness but also enhance tenant satisfaction and retention  ultimately leading to increased profitability and long-term asset value ” jeff barney  president of tp-link systems  a global provider of networking devices and accessories  headquartered in irvine  calif.  told technewsworld.  “property owners can generate revenue by providing iot and property-wide wi-fi services to the tenant ” he added.  many multifamily properties are looking at different ways to deploy and adopt connectivity technologies  noted parks analyst kristen hanich  but they’re also carefully considering the financial results they can expect by rolling them out.  “they want to know what the return on investment [roi] will be on operations ” she told technewsworld  “and if they’re a short-term kind of investment company  how much will be added to a property’s value by rolling out some of these technologies.”  gaining competitive edge the multifamily real estate market is embracing connectivity and iot to enhance tenant experiences and attract tech-savvy renters  explained mark n. vena  president and principal analyst at smarttech research in las vegas.  “smart building technologies like automated lighting  temperature control  and security systems improve operational efficiency and lower maintenance costs for property managers ” he told technewsworld. “additionally  connected devices enable better energy management  reducing utility expenses and promoting sustainability.”  “as tenants increasingly expect seamless connectivity and smart living solutions  properties offering these amenities gain a competitive edge in the market ” he added.  hanich explained that many new properties under construction for the last few years are about to hit the market. “when they do  we expect that a lot of existing properties are going to have to compete more tightly for renters and residents ” she said. “so we expect that a lot of existing properties  older properties  are going to look at what amenities they can offer folks and see what they can do when it comes to some of these connected solutions.”  however  according to the parks report  a lack of suitable pre-existing networking infrastructure is a top barrier holding multiple dwelling units (mdus) back from widely deploying iot.  gain insights with the customer effort index many existing properties were created without suitable wiring or the infrastructure to run new wiring  it continued. additionally  many properties do not own the wiring infrastructure  making new connectivity deployments costly or not feasible. as a result  older properties are far less likely to offer smart amenities and have worse experiences with their existing infrastructure.  parks researchers found that 82% of properties 10 years old or older that offer wi-fi have difficulty maintaining device connections on the network compared with just 13% of newer properties.  internet must be available immediately poor connections have been a chronic problem due to wireless environments becoming increasingly crowded and wireless devices proliferating  barney noted  but the introduction of wi-fi 7 promises to address those problems with more stable connections.  in addition  multi-gig ethernet is becoming available. “with multi-gig ethernet  more and more bands are becoming available and are being deployed to the properties to help people get connected ” barney said.  infrastructure woes aren’t the only challenges facing tech in the multifamily residential market. “there’s a lack of understanding about what these technologies can and cannot do  and a lack of skills on how to set them up so they perform as intended and provide a better return on investment ” rob enderle  president and principal analyst with the enderle group  an advisory services firm in bend  ore. told technewsworld.  the parks report maintained that connectivity services must connect residents to experiences they care about: entertainment  work  safety  and smart living.  furthermore  it must be ready at move-in  it added. according to parks’ research  the majority of mdu residents say having internet ready to go immediately after moving in is “very important” in their next home. that ranks third among 16 amenities rated by consumers in the research  just after good insulation  soundproofing  and low-cost internet.  parks also noted that more and more mdu residents are using smart home tech acquired themselves and from their properties. it explained that 22% of apartment renters and 58% of condo owners use smart home devices today  and these residents need modern networking services to support them.  in fact  it added  many properties are offering smart home devices as a differentiator to attract and retain residents — a differentiator that appears to be popular  as 79% of mdu dwellers with property-provided smart home devices and services are satisfied with them.  curbing insurance costs connected technology can impact another concern in the multifamily residence market: insurance. citing information from tbm multifamily  an insurance and risk management firm  parks noted premiums have soared 10% to 40% for multifamily property owners.  motivate your team for successful cx execution the report explained that properties are seeing the benefits of deploying risk-mitigation technology solutions to reduce the damages caused by catastrophic events such as leaks and floods  which damage multiple units. these solutions are not typically resident-facing but have a strong roi when implemented on a large scale through reductions in insurance rate increases and preventing small leaks from becoming large incidents.  there is a growing trend towards insurance discounts for properties with connected solutions  such as water leak detectors. however  parks acknowledged that this is still at an early stage  and properties may need to negotiate rates or change providers to see the full benefits.  “without question  connectivity and iot in the multifamily market offer significant benefits by enhancing tenant satisfaction  streamlining property management  and improving operational efficiency ” vena said.  “these technologies also contribute to sustainability efforts through better energy management and resource optimization. as smart living becomes more prevalent  embracing connectivity and iot can help properties stay competitive and future-proof their offerings.”,Technology,https://www.technewsworld.com/story/multifamily-residences-turn-to-tech-for-tenant-appeal-efficiency-report-179440.html
74,Honda Civic  Porsche 911  Ramcharger Among New Hybrid Models for 2025,hybrid cars—once the butt of jokes—are having a moment. while the toyota prius remains the poster child for the gas-electric powertrain  a growing number of alternatives have cropped up over the years. now  pretty much every type of new vehicle offers a hybrid model  from sedans and minivans to suvs  sports cars  and pickup trucks. along with conventional hybrids such as the regular prius  plug-in hybrids (a.k.a. phevs) typically have bigger batteries and  predictably  need to be plugged in to fully charge. phevs can also drive in pure-electric mode for more than several miles  so they can more successfully moonlight as an ev.  with those distinctions out of the way  we've compiled a list of all the new hybrid and plug-in-hybrid models that are going on sale in the united states for the first time. some are currently on showroom floors  while others will reach dealers in the not-too-distant future  and all are 2025 models.    bentley flying spur 2025 bentley flying spurview photosbentley bentley's grand sedan gives up its old w-12 engine and gets a new plug-in-hybrid treatment. the latter pairs a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter v-8 with an electric motor  and that combination results in a total of 771 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque. with a 22.0-kwh battery pack that lives under the trunk  we estimate that the phev flying spur can travel about 40 miles on electricity alone. its prestige and power are only matched by its price tag  which starts at $276 450.  review  price  specs  bentley continental gt 2025 bentley continental gtc speedview photosbentley look  filthy rich folks need hybrids too  and the bentley continental gt is one helluva plug-in hybrid. as with its four-door sibling  the flying spur  bentley's old w-12 engine has been put out to pasture. instead  the only powertrain option is a twin-turbo 4.0-liter v-8 matched with an electric motor  making 771 horsepower and 738 pound-feet of torque. tell us where you've heard that before. the gt's estimated electric range should be similar to the flying spur. prices for the coupe start at around $306k  opting for the droptop pushes the starting price to $336k.  review  price  specs  advertisement - continue reading below  bmw m5 2025 bmw m5view photosbmw the m5 represents the ultimate version of the bmw 5-series  and now it packs a herculean plug-in-hybrid powertrain. 7-1-7. that's how much combined horsepower this high-tech m5 makes from an electric motor and a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter v-8. along with 738 pound-feet of torque and standard all-wheel drive  bmw claims the m5 phev will hit 60 mph in 3.0 seconds  this despite weighing about 5400 pounds. some will tout its claimed 190-mph top speed  others will appreciate its estimated 25-mile driving range. its price starts at a cool $123 275.  review  price  specs  bmw m5 touring 2025 bmw m5 touringview photosbmw not only does the bmw m5 feature a plug-in-hybrid powertrain for the first time  but its wagon variant (called touring) also makes its u.s. debut. the m5 touring phev has a bigger cargo area and a slightly lower base price than its sedan counterpart ($122 675 versus $123 275)  but it shares a twin-turbo 4.0-liter v-8 and electric motor that together make 717 horsepower and 739 pound-feet of torque. bmw estimates that the wagon's extra weight will make it take 3.2 seconds to hit 60 mph. however  as with the m5 sedan  the touring should be able to go 25 miles in ev mode.  review  price  specs   advertisement - continue reading below  honda civic hybrid 2025 honda civic hybridview photosmarc urbano|car and driver ok  so this isn't the first time honda has sold a civic-badged hybrid on our shores. however  it has been about a decade since the last time it did  and the revived version has compelling characteristics. it is offered in both sedan and hatchback body styles  with each featuring an atkinson-cycle 2.0-liter four-cylinder and a pair of electric motors. that setup generates 200 horsepower and 238 pound-feet of torque (the most of any civic). while the hybrid is heavier than its nonhybrid siblings  it's quicker and more fuel-efficient. the civic hybrid earns up to 49 mpg combined  whereas the next best model peaks at 36 mpg combined. the gas-electric model starts at just under $30k.  review  price  and specs  kia carnival hybrid 2025 kia carnival hevview photosmarc urbano|car and driver kia apparently doesn't want chrysler and toyota to have all the fun. both the chrysler pacifica and toyota sienna have offered hybrid options for several years now. for 2025  the kia carnival does too. its powertrain mixes a six-speed automatic  an electric motor  and a 1.6-liter turbo four. that 242-hp package helped kia's hybrid minivan hit 60 mph in an unremarkable 7.8 seconds. more remarkable is the gas-electric carnival has an epa-estimated 33 mpg combined;

75,Volkswagen and Rivian Are Working on a New Electric Golf,the e-golf you see here had to die so that the bulbous id.3 could live. however  volkswagen is preparing a switcheroo. it plans to delete the combustion engine from its most popular car once again. when that happens  the id.3 is likely to be axed  as kai grünitz  the head of technical development  hinted at the beginning of the year. the automaker's boss  thomas schäfer  has now revealed player two is about to enter the electric golf game.  rivian is lending vw a helping hand to develop the ninth-generation golf. the new compact hatchback will be exclusively electric and ride on the forthcoming scalable systems platform (ssp). a couple of weeks ago  vw and rivian launched their joint venture worth $5.8 billion to engineer electric architecture and software for next-gen cars. we're learning the golf mk9 will be among the early adopters.  speaking with automotive news  schäfer confirmed vw needs rivian's assistance to work on a complete reinvention of its legendary car: we decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle. it will happen with rivian  the joint venture  where we put the new electric electronics architecture together. but we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. so we'll start with the golf.  top videos:    we certainly didn’t have a vw+rivian golf on our bingo card  but it shows how much the automotive industry is changing as legacy automakers need help from tech-savvy newcomers. the electric mk9 isn’t coming anytime soon  though. the top brass from wolfsburg said we’ll have to wait until 2029 to see the car  a “real volume product” with some big shoes to fill.  since it won't be launched in the next four years  vw still has plenty of time to improve the id.3 we mentioned earlier. a fully redesigned version with better hardware and a higher-quality interior featuring more physical buttons is coming in 2026. logic tells us there will be an overlap between the id.3 and the electric golf since vw is unlikely to drop the former after only three years.  when the electric golf arrives in 2029  it won't spell the end for the conventionally powered model. the mk8 launched in late 2019 with gasoline  diesel  and plug-in hybrid powertrains could stick around until 2035. that's when the european union promised to ban sales of new cars that generate harmful emissions  effectively outlawing the combustion engine.  the e-golf redux won't be the first vw product to benefit from rivian's know-how. schäfer said audi and porsche will lead the way  with cars arriving as early as 2027. when the joint venture was launched earlier this month  the two companies said their new electrical architecture and software technology would be compatible with all relevant vehicle segments  as small as subcompact cars.,Technology,https://www.motor1.com/news/742641/vw-rivian-collaboration-electric-golf/
76,Wildfire Mission Autonomy Successfully Demonstrated,sikorsky and rain have successfully demonstrated how an autonomous black hawk helicopter can be commanded to take off  identify the location and size of a small fire  and then accurately drop water to suppress the flames.  carried out on october 29 at sikorsky headquarters in stratford  the rapid wildfire response demonstration showed the effective fusion of sikorsky’s matrix flight autonomy with rain’s wildfire mission autonomy system to suppress a fire in its incipient stage using this innovative firefighting uav.  during the 30-minute flight demonstration  guests used a tablet to command the black hawk aircraft to take off  search and find the fire  then drop water from a bambi bucket slung 60 feet beneath the aircraft.    each of three successive water drops extinguished a 12-inch diameter propane-fueled fire ring emitting a 3-to-6-inch-tall flame  demonstrating the precision of the rain fire perception and targeting capability. the rain system also rapidly adjusted the flight path to account for an 8-to-10-knot crosswind during each water drop.  sikorsky  a lockheed martin company  had safety pilots in the black hawk cockpit to monitor the flight controls  but were hands-off until the aircraft landed. representatives attending the demonstration provided real-time input and observations to the rain — a leader in autonomous aerial wildfire containment technology — and sikorsky teams.   igor cherepinsky  director of sikorsky innovations’ rapid development/prototyping group  commented  “with rain’s wildfire mission software loaded onto the aircraft and a tablet  wildland firefighters in the field could deploy autonomous black hawk or firehawk helicopters to search and attack wildfires before they spread out of control.”   genevieve biggs  director of the gordon and betty moore foundation’s wildfire resilience initiative and special projects program  said  “this technology that we used to think of as being on the horizon is here now  no longer just a figment of our imagination.   “it’s humbling to see this impressive machine  and think about the improvement in safety that becomes possible when you’re layering into wildland firefighting an autonomous operation  as rain and sikorsky have been able to do together.”  maxwell brodie  rain ceo  added  “government agencies  aerial firefighting operators  and investors are coming together to learn and see how both flight and mission autonomy can help prevent high intensity million-acre wildfires.   “wildfires cost the united states over $390 billion annually  and multiple risk factors are set to grow up to 30% by 2030. we look forward to demonstrating to lawmakers how autonomous aircraft can stop fires from breaking out  or continue the fight into the night  and in turbulent and smoky conditions  where crewed aircraft wouldn’t venture.”,Technology,https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/2024/11/wildfire-mission-autonomy-successfully-demonstrated/?utm_medium=AIAA_Website&utm_source=rasa_io&utm_campaign=Industry_News
77,Rocket Lab nails two missions within 24 hours — one in each hemisphere,rocket lab set a new speed record for launch turnaround time  successfully executing two electron missions in 24 hours.  the company added in a statement that this is also the first time any launch operator has completed a mission from each hemisphere within that time frame.   rocket lab  which was founded in new zealand  maintains a launch pad there and at the mid-atlantic regional spaceport in virginia. the company has cited its ability to launch from pads in the u.s. and new zealand as a competitive advantage; when the virginia pad became operational in 2022  rocket lab ceo peter beck said it enabled customers to “enjoy unmatched control over their launch schedule and orbital requirements.”   those precise orbital insertions include access to polar and sun-synchronous orbits from the launch site in new zealand  and to mid-inclination orbits from virginia. rocket lab also operates a suborbital version of electron  called hypersonic accelerator suborbital test electron (haste) from the american launch pad. haste is used as a testbed for hypersonics and suborbital technologies.  these most recent launches included a haste suborbital launch from virginia for an unnamed customer  and the launch of a pair of satellites from the french company kinéis from mahia peninsula  new zealand.   the company has completed 14 launches so far this year  but there likely won’t be too many more. in its most recent earnings announcement  rocket lab estimated it would launch the rocket 15 to 18 times in 2024. while rocket lab is best known for operating the small electron rocket  which is second only to spacex’s falcon 9 in terms of activity  the majority of the company’s revenue actually comes from its space systems business  which includes spacecraft design and manufacturing and the sale of satellite components. of the $105 million in revenues the company earned in the third quarter of this year  for example  $21 million came from launch services and $84 million from the space systems segment.   that proportion could change slightly when rocket lab brings its medium-lift rocket  neutron  online mid-next year. the company currently estimates launching that rocket once in 2025  three times in 2026  and five times in 2027.,Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/25/rocket-lab-nails-two-missions-within-24-hours-one-in-each-hemisphere/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJlT6m77DdnFL31j__LhxGbpDUkBK6_B9DRomWBUH-Cy7bWDlC4h9B-xer8GfHDVPSCUX9aKYnlStEO2ZIB5PMs_7S1Xwv0wzp6Tu45NuiMupcuEoEgwDL-_bPx1nZIWjOoTye85pbQafyLoQTSueMBHpNetZqeUYyFW8vfe5cZv&utm_medium=AIAA_Website&utm_source=rasa_io&utm_campaign=Industry_News
78,Innovative nanostructures pave the way for advanced robotics -- and mini dinosaurs,as a proof-of-concept  the researchers made more than 50 nanoscale objects  including a 'nano-dinosaur'  a 'dancing robot' and a mini-australia that is 150 nanometres wide  a thousand times narrower than a human hair.  the research is published today in the pre-eminent robotics journal science robotics.  the research  led by first author dr minh tri luu and research team leader dr shelley wickham  focuses on the creation of modular dna origami voxels that can be assembled into complex three-dimensional structures. (where a pixel is two-dimensional  a voxel is realised in 3d.)  these programmable nanostructures can be tailored for specific functions  allowing for rapid prototyping of diverse configurations. this flexibility is crucial for developing nanoscale robotic systems that can perform tasks in synthetic biology  nanomedicine and materials science.  dr wickham  who holds a joint position with the schools of chemistry and physics in the faculty of science  said: the results are a bit like using meccano  the children's engineering toy  or building a chain-like cat's cradle. but instead of macroscale metal or string  we use nanoscale biology to build robots with huge potential.  dr luu said: we've created a new class of nanomaterials with adjustable properties  enabling diverse applications -- from adaptive materials that change optical properties in response to the environment to autonomous nanorobots designed to seek out and destroy cancer cells.  to assemble the voxels  the team incorporate additional dna strands on to the exterior of the nanostructures  with the new strands acting as programmable binding sites.  dr luu said: these sites act like velcro with different colours -- designed so that only strands with matching 'colours' (in fact  complementary dna sequences) can connect.  he said this innovative approach allows precise control over how voxels bind to each other  enabling the creation of customisable  highly specific architectures.  one of the most exciting applications of this technology is its potential to create nanoscale robotic boxes capable of delivering drugs directly to targeted areas within the body. by using dna origami  researchers can design these nanobots to respond to specific biological signals  ensuring medications are released only when and where they are needed. this targeted approach could enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments while minimising side effects.  in addition to drug delivery  the researchers are exploring the development of new materials that can change properties in response to environmental stimuli. for instance  these materials could be engineered to be responsive to higher loads or alter their structural characteristics based on changes in temperature or acidic (ph) levels. such responsive materials have the potential to transform medical  computing and electronics industries.  dr wickham said: this work enables us to imagine a world where nanobots can get to work on a huge range of tasks  from treating the human body to building futuristic electronic devices.  the research team is also investigating energy-efficient methods for processing optical signals  which could lead to improved image verification technologies. by harnessing the unique properties of dna origami  these systems could improve the speed and accuracy of optical signal processing  paving the way for enhanced techniques in medical diagnostics or security.  dr luu  a postdoctoral researcher in the school of chemistry  said: our work demonstrates the incredible potential of dna origami to create versatile and programmable nanostructures. the ability to design and assemble these components opens new avenues for innovation in nanotechnology.  dr wickham said: this research not only highlights the capabilities of dna nanostructures but also emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing science. we are excited to see how our findings can be applied to real-world challenges in health  materials science and energy.  as researchers continue to refine these technologies  the potential for creating adaptive nanomachines that can operate in complex environments  such as within the human body  is becoming increasingly feasible.  ,Technology,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/11/241127165726.htm
79,Teamwork  Safety Keeps Phoenix Transit Line Project on Track,while clocking in at 1.6 miles in length  valley metro’s newest section of its phoenix light rail system packs in many firsts for the area within its tight footprint. the northwest phase ii extension provides the network’s first elevated light rail track and station  the first rail-only bridge over interstate 17 and the first multimodal transit center and parking structure for the system.  additionally  it’s the first time light rail has been connected to the west valley. and the project features the first utilization of steel fiber concrete on the guideway. while breaking all of this new ground  the team also faced a utility relocation backlog that threatened to delay the project. instead  the team brought the project into the station early  with an impressive $40 million in savings and a nearly spotless safety record.   interstate 17 the extension features the first rail-only bridge over interstate 17  a heavily used commuter corridor. photo courtesy mccarthy building cos.  designed by jacobs  the extension runs west on dunlap avenue starting at 19th avenue  then turns north on 25th avenue and runs across i-17 at mountain view road  ending on the west side of the freeway near the former metrocenter mall. in addition to the elevated station on the west side of i-17  crews built two new at-grade stations and two other bridges. the four-story transit center is served by five bus routes and contains a 90 830-sq-ft parking garage with 252 stalls for valley metro’s park and ride program.  valley metro awarded a construction manager at-risk contract to the joint venture of kiewit-mccarthy (kmjv) early on when the project was still at about 15% design  which enabled the team to perform extensive value engineering to keep the project moving forward under its limited funding.   during a cost savings and risk workshop  kmjv  the city of phoenix  valley metro  jacobs and others “locked ourselves in a conference room for three days and brainstormed what scope of work was unnecessary and how do we meet the functionality of the project at the lowest cost ” says nick wiatrowski  area manager at kiewit. through the strategy  elements such as the lighting package were simplified  and in the end 141 cost saving ideas were agreed upon  carving out $61 million from the initial forecast.  northwest phase ii extension light rail transit photo courtesy mccarthy building cos.  the final construction cost came in at $273.8 million  around $40 million under budget.  the project received funding from regional transportation pools and ballot measures  plus $158 million from the capital investment grant program through the federal transit administration.  at the ribbon-cutting ceremony in january  fta administrator nuria fernandez said: “i am proud to be back in phoenix  less than three years after signing the grant that funded this important extension that will make such a difference in the lives of people in this region. this was the first project funded by fta under president biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law  and the city and valley metro have done incredible work ... delivering the project earlier than expected.”  crews working crews from the contracting team were empowered to identify safety concerns and come up with appropriate solutions. this included the power to stop work at any time if unsafe practices were observed. photo courtesy mccarthy building cos.  utility backlog the project broke ground in 2020 right as the industry was dealing with the peak of the pandemic. but the impacts of covid-19 manifested in unexpected ways on the project.  “for phoenix  covid really created an enormous construction boom  and there was just an insurmountable amount of construction that was occurring ” says wiatrowski. “it put a ton of stress on the local utility companies right at about the same time where we needed them on our project relocating utilities so that we could begin our work.” a seven-month project delay loomed due to the labor and resource shortages at the third-party utilities. “that wasn’t acceptable for anybody ” he adds.  “i would love to do a project again with the same team and the same vibe and recreate that magic.” —chris jacobson  svp operations  mccarthy building cos. to claw back lost time  the team held another round of brainstorming and implemented strategies such as double shifts on critical items  resequencing work to reduce the number of traffic control phases and enlisting extra bench strength from the two companies.  a decade ago  kmjv worked together on another best projects winner  the phx sky train  which judges lauded for combining the strengths of kiewit’s infrastructure experience and mccarthy’s vertical construction acumen. chris jacobson  senior vice president of operations for mccarthy  says the “secret sauce” of the light rail project was “our expertise played in the exact same way with kiewit focused on the horizontal and mccarthy focused on the [elevated] station  but our teams were integrated.”  to ensure the greatest level of partnering  kmjv says both firms were equally involved in “planning and decision-making  even allocating internal resources to one another for highest project outcomes.”  due to the shared labor  equipment and self-performance expertise  kmjv says it was able to self-perform extensive parts of the job  including 21 000 linear ft of underground utility relocations  earthwork  bridge widenings  the i-17 overpass bridge  mse walls  concrete for the metro center station and all of the double-track installation.  wiatrowski says one of the most significant ideas from the value engineering workshop was to substitute steel fiber in the concrete mix for the embedded guideway  direct fixated track and bridge elements in lieu of extensive reinforcing bars. the team developed the mix with arizona state university  which validated the methodology for safety and strength.  this method not only reduced the amount of steel  but its stronger load-bearing capacity reduced the thickness of concrete from 14 in. to around 12 in.  wiatrowski adds. in all  the method reduced embodied carbon and cut track construction time in half by 121 days  saving millions of dollars. concrete tolerances for the 180-ft-long elevated platform left “microscopic room for error ” says the team  requiring 550 pre-pour measurements to ensure accuracy.  new multimodal transit center the extension featured the light rail system’s first elevated station  located at the terminus of a new multimodal transit center  also built as part of the project. photo courtesy mccarthy building cos.  leadership in safety the safety experts tasked with selecting the winner of enr’s special safety award praised the depth and dedication of kmjv’s program.  “looking at the different structures that we had—several bridges working in and around traffic  lots of heavy equipment—there’s a pitfall around every corner ” says jacobson. “our team did an awesome job of communicating all the way down to the craft level.” in combining their safety cultures  both contractors compared their internal practices to select whichever one was more rigorous. this resulted in a high-intensity safety program for all team members to adopt within a culture of collective decision-making  says kmjv.  the team also used underground mapping software that merged as-builts with designed utility relocations to visualize all utilities via gps  made accessible to all workers on their mobile devices to prevent dangerous utility strikes. with construction continuing over three summer seasons  heat mitigation was also a primary concern  jacobson says.  artwork artwork is incorporated throughout the project’s ground level and elevated stations and along the alignment  reflecting the community the transit line serves.  out of 786 819 worker hours  the team’s osha recordable incident rate and lost-time rate both came in at 0.25  due to “a single subcontractor recordable incident on the project involving an employee coming into contact with a piece of the corner of the garage formwork system  resulting in a laceration ” according to the entry form. the end result  though  was a safer site when “the team implemented a policy of covering these potential contact hazards by means such as tennis balls  foam and other cushioning materials.”  adrian ruiz  director  safety and security for valley metro  says that the team’s “safety efforts protected not only the workers performing the work but the very active and vibrant retail and residential area surrounding the build site.” in addition  the design of the “bridge span and elevated station incorporated safety features and design components intended to reduce risk and mitigate hazards for the public ” he adds.  community engagement was key throughout  from mitigating impacts to businesses during construction to the design of the project. multiple art elements are featured along the extension  created by seven artists reflecting the character and history of the community.  “the test of a really good jv is if you want to work together again  and i think nick [wiatrowski] and i text each other about every week  figuring out what can be our next one ” says jacobson. “i would love to do a project again with the same team and the same vibe and recreate that magic.”

80,How robotaxis are trying to win passengers' trust,autonomous vehicles are already clocking up millions of miles on public roads  but they face an uphill battle to convince people to climb in to enjoy the ride.  a few weeks ago  i took a tour of san francisco in one of waymo's self-driving cars. as we drove around the city  one thing that struck me was how comfortable people had become with not seeing a driver. not only were there multiple driverless vehicles on any given street at any given time  but tourists no longer had their mouths agape as one drove by. the technology has become a familiar sight.  inside the vehicle itself  there were signs of how waymo is trying to inspire a similar feeling among their passengers. the all-electric car offers a warm welcome to passengers by name and plays music as they climb inside. a screen positioned in front of the rear seats offers those along for the ride the option of seeing a follow-along map of the route  as well as settings for temperature and music. another screen beside the steering wheel shows images of what's around the vehicle. as we drive  i can see people sitting inside buses alongside us  dogs crossing the street ahead and children skipping along the sidewalk.  waymo wants you to see what the vehicle can – it wants you to trust it.  it is part of a wider trend within the autonomous ride-hailing industry. the technology allowing these self-driving vehicles to weave their way through busy city traffic is being used out there in a handful of cities around the world. what waymo and its competitors need to do is to convince passengers to climb inside them.   there is something very important about being able to know where the car is going  that the car sees what you're seeing – megan neese yet  research seems to suggest that the public in the us and the uk are reticent about riding in self-driving vehicles  with safety being among the most common concerns. a lot of it comes down to the trust people are willing to place in the technology and the companies that build the vehicles. but also there seems to be a higher bar when it comes to attitudes on the safety of autonomous vehicles compared to conventional cars.  for waymo  the solution is to instill confidence in the robotic systems driving the vehicle.  there is something very important about being able to know where the car is going  that the car sees what you're seeing  says megan neese  waymo's head of product and customer research  from beside me during our tour of san francisco. the company plans to keep the seats forward-facing with a steering wheel in its next generation car  she says. it's a familiar set-up in traditional taxis and that ability to see where the car is going helps people trust the car  she says.  getty images waymo’s cars have a typical car layout and feature a screen beside the steering wheel that displays what the car can see around it (credit: getty images)getty images waymo’s cars have a typical car layout and feature a screen beside the steering wheel that displays what the car can see around it (credit: getty images)  waymo  which is owned by google's parent company alphabet  began offering robotaxi services in the us without a safety driver on board in 2020. it now provides 150 000 paid rides a week across san francisco and los angeles in california  and phoenix in arizona.  in the grand scheme of ride-sharing  it is still small scale – uber claims to facilitate around 200 million trips every week worldwide – but the market is growing.  it is also highly competitive. ensuring passengers are at ease and comfortable is likely to be where much of the battle will be fought.  amazon-backed zoox  which plans to enter the market in 2025  is taking a different approach to gaining consumer trust. it aims to let passengers lose themselves in the ride by not seeing what's ahead or what the autonomous driver can see.    weeks after my waymo ride-along  zoox invited me to try their test vehicle at their foster city headquarters outside of san francisco on a prescribed course between two office buildings. needless to say  it was a very different experience than riding waymo in the wild  across a densely urban environment.   zoox's offering is a purpose-built vehicle that is bi-directional  with no forward-facing or rear-facing windows. there is also no steering wheel  no pedals and no display screens to show the vehicle's surroundings. instead  four seats face each other  bay seating-style. on either side there are sliding doors featuring large windows. a small screen next to each passenger allows them to personalise temperature controls and select music while a wireless charging pad sits on a flat divider between the seats. the vegan leather seats are dark green and the ceiling has twinkling lights set into it. it felt like a disneyland ride.  martine paris zoox have opted for a less conventional vehicle design with sliding doors on both sides and bay seating inside (credit: martine paris)martine paris zoox have opted for a less conventional vehicle design with sliding doors on both sides and bay seating inside (credit: martine paris)  to help gain consumer trust  zoox has also begun publicly revealing details of its fusion center  where human operators can provide guidance to vehicle remotely to get it out of an unfamilar situation – which the company describes as a little like laying a path of digital breadcrumbs for it to follow. during testing  the company says its vehicles received remote guidance for 1% of the total driving time.    waymo previously did not talk publicly about its teleoperations centre  but earlier this year revealed it too has humans on hand to dial in to provide assistance. but rather than using remote drivers  waymo's fleet response team answers questions from the autonomous vehicle about the choices it should make in ambiguous situations.   by comparison  general motors-owned cruise lost its permit to operate in california and had to pause operations after one of its vehicles dragged a pedestrian for 20ft (6m) after they were thrown into its path in october 2023. since the incident  the company has been keen to highlight the layers of human support it uses with its vehicles. these include a team of fleet monitors  remote assistance and on-the-ground personnel to provide in-person assistance. cruise says that prior to its operational pause last year  its vehicles connected to the remote assistance teams 3% of the time they were driving autonomously in urban environments  but that intervention wasn't necessary on all those occasions. the company says remote assistance provided on-road support for 0.6% of total autonomous driving time.  cruise's chief executive and co-founders resigned a few months after the accident  while 900 other employees were laid off. the company has since resumed testing with safety drivers behind the wheel in phoenix  arizona and dallas  texas. it has also struck a multiyear deal to bring its cars onto the uber platform.,Technology,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20241115-how-robotaxis-are-trying-to-win-passengers-trust
